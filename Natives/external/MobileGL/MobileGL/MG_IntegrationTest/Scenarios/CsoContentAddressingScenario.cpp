// Scenario - THE CSO CONTENT-ADDRESSING NEGATIVE CONTROL (gate G12).
//
// P2's render-state CSO is content-addressed: the client hashes the 396 pipeline bytes, probes a
// 64-entry cache, memcmps a hash hit and reuses the handle. The whole design is measured against
// a knob that turns that off - kMGPipeBehaviourNoCsoContentAddressing, bit 63 of the runtime
// MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH bitmask - so that "push is slower" can be told apart from "the CSO design is
// slower" (P2 brief D.4.5). A measurement knob has one characteristic failure mode: it stops
// steering anything and every later number is quietly taken against a switch that does nothing.
// This file is the entry that cannot let that happen.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS, per arm, and why those are the right shapes:
//
//   content-addressed (MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH=0x7f)
//       A Blaze3D blend toggle - enable / draw / disable / draw, N times, which is the workload
//       the CsoCache exists for (ARCHITECTURE.md 5.1: the push happens at validate rather than in
//       the setter precisely because Blaze3D brackets every batch this way) - visits exactly TWO
//       distinct pipeline subsets. So the mint count must stay small and BOUNDED while the bind
//       count grows with the draws: csom << csob.
//
//   no content addressing (MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH=0x800000000000007f)
//       Every pipeline-version change mints a fresh CSO and the map is never probed, so mint and
//       bind must move together: csom == csob. This is the assertion a dead switch fails - with
//       the bit ignored, this arm would report csom << csob just like the other one.
//
//   both arms
//       The PIXELS must not move. The quad is drawn with alpha 1.0 through
//       GL_SRC_ALPHA / GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, so the blended and unblended draws produce the
//       same colour by construction and the readback is the same image in both arms and after
//       every toggle. "The counters moved and the picture did not" is the whole claim.
//
// HOW THE COUNTERS ARE READ. MG_Util::PipeStats is internal to the library and this module cannot
// link against it (ScenarioFixture.h explains why: on Android this binary links the SHIPPING
// libMobileGL.so, built -fvisibility=hidden). The library's own summary line is the only channel,
// so each lane sets MOBILEGL_PIPE_STATS=1, MOBILEGL_PIPE_STATS_PERIOD=1 - one line per
// eglSwapBuffers - and a MOBILEGL_LOG_FILE_PATH of its OWN. The log path has to be private: the
// library opens it fopen(path, "w"), so every process in a lane truncates it, and a whole-file
// read in a shared lane races a neighbour's bring-up. That is the same rule, and the same
// remedy, as PipeVerifyArmingScenario's arming lane.
//
// The window a summary line reports is "since the previous line" (PipeStats::FormatWindowLine), so
// the workload runs inside ONE frame: a swap before it closes the setup window, and the swap after
// it emits a line whose csom / csob cover the toggle loop and nothing else.
//
// WHY IT CAN SKIP. The counters are minted by the client-side tracker (P2 package B), and this
// file is written against the P2 contract commit, before that package lands. Until the tracker
// exists there is no CSO to mint, csom is structurally 0 and an assertion about its ratio to csob
// would be a statement about nothing. The build answers the question rather than a hand-maintained
// list: MG_IntegrationTest/CMakeLists.txt greps every source under MG_Impl/Pipe/ for the two
// counters' names and passes the answer in as MGITEST_PIPE_TRACKER_PRESENT, with a
// CONFIGURE_DEPENDS on that directory and on each file it finds so the answer cannot go stale.
// It is a CONTENT probe, not a filename probe, precisely so that the owning package keeps control
// of its own file layout - it implements the tracker and the cache header-only today, and a glob
// for `Tracker.cpp` would have kept this control skipping forever after that package landed, with
// a reason that had become false. When an emitter lands the arms arm themselves; until then the
// entries are registered, visible and SKIPPED with the reason - never absent, and never green for
// having asserted nothing.
