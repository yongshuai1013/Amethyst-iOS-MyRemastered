# THE RETRACE-SPLIT LANE'S NEGATIVE CONTROL: a PULL library must red this split retrace.
#
# This file is the body of .github/workflows/test.yml's "Negative control (pull library)" step in
# the retrace-split job, extracted for the reason given at the top of
# scripts/ci/split_negative_controls.sh: a `run:` block is unreviewable and untestable off a
# runner, and scripts/ci/control_smoke_test.sh now runs THIS file rather than a hand-made copy.
#
# WHAT THE CONTROL IS FOR. The retrace-split job replays a trace against the SPLIT runtime under
# MOBILEGL_TRANSPORT=inproc. OpenRA scores ssim 1.000000 against a MONOLITH library too - measured -
# so the picture is not and cannot be this lane's gate. What stands between the job and a green that
# ran monolith end to end is run_trace_case.cmake's transport-resolution assertion
# (run_trace_case.cmake:265-289): the library must have logged
# "MOBILEGL_TRANSPORT=inproc - the MGPipe record stream", which exists only in
# ConfigLoader::InitTransport's InProcess arm, which exists only under MOBILEGL_BUILD_DISAGGREGATED.
# This control swaps the pull library over the frozen path and requires the same replay to fail FOR
# THAT REASON.
#
# WHAT THE REVIEW FOUND (ID-46 finding 8 part (b), CONFIRMED by execution against the REAL ctest in
# a REAL build tree; ID-48 assigns it here). Two holes, both of which let the control pass while
# asserting nothing:
#
#   1. NO SELECTION GUARD AT ALL - unlike the split lane's run_control, which has had one since
#      review finding M-4. With a case/backend regex matching no tests, `--no-tests=error` exits 8,
#      and the old `if [ "${control_rc}" -eq 0 ]` accepted 8 as "the pull library turned it red".
#      The verifier measured exactly that: "real ctest exit for a regex matching NO tests: 8",
#      HARNESS_EXIT=0. An empty selection was the one thing this control could not tell apart from
#      a working transport-identity assertion.
#   2. ONLY "non-zero ctest" WAS CHECKED after the nm identity check. The nm check establishes that
#      the library IS a pull build; it says nothing about why the replay failed. A loader failure, a
#      missing fixture or a timeout all passed the control.
#
# Both are closed below: the selection is counted before the run, and the red must carry
# run_trace_case.cmake's own words.
#
# Usage:  retrace_pull_library_control.sh <case> <backend>
#   CTEST           ctest binary                      (default: ctest)
#   CONTROL_TMPDIR  scratch dir                       (default: ${RUNNER_TEMP:-/tmp})
#   PULL_LIBRARY    the pull libMobileGL.so to swap in
#   FROZEN_LIBRARY  the path every case has baked in, which PULL_LIBRARY is copied over

# run_trace_case.cmake's own sentences for "this library never resolved the transport", one per
# line (grep -F takes its patterns newline-separated). Anchored on the distinctive clause rather
# than on the whole paragraph, which carries substituted paths.
#
# TWO SENTENCES SINCE P6's LOG RENAME, and the second is the one a pull library actually gets.
# A pull build has one log role and writes MOBILEGL_LOG_FILE_PATH unchanged - output/mobilegl.log
# (MG_Util/Debug/Log.h, the pull arm of RoleLogPath) - while the disaggregated build's readers,
# run_trace_case.cmake among them, read output/mobilegl.client.log. So the pull library never
# reaches the marker search that says "never reported resolving it": the runner stops one check
# earlier, at "the run wrote no <client log>, so there is no evidence the transport ever
# resolved". Both are the transport-identity assertion refusing the same library for the same
# reason (a pull build has no split log for the marker to be in); neither is a loader failure, a
# missing fixture, a timeout or an SSIM drop, which are the reds hole 2 below exists to refuse.
# MEASURED on the B3 package tree with the real ctest and the real pull library: with only the
# first sentence here, the control exited 1 through hole 2 on every pull-library run - the step
# had been red for no product reason since the rename. scripts/ci/testdata/stub_ctest.sh's
# retrace-evidence-nolog mode reproduces the shape.
EVIDENCE='never reported resolving it
no evidence the transport ever resolved'
# EVERY LINE OF EVIDENCE IS A PATTERN, SO AN EMPTY LINE IS A PATTERN THAT MATCHES EVERYTHING. A
# trailing newline, or a blank line between the two sentences, would turn hole 2's check below
# into "any red will do". The smoke test's "red without the transport-resolution message" case
# would catch that (22/23), but only once somebody ran it; this refuses it here, before the
