// The CLIENT's slot allocator: the thing that mints every MGPipeHandle in the system
// (ARCHITECTURE.md 4.2 - no create_* call in the catalogue returns a server-cast handle,
// which is what lets the whole catalogue be remoted with zero creation round trips).
//
// Per kind: a free list plus a high-water mark, so slots stay DENSE and the server's object
// table is an array rather than a hash map. It has nothing to do with MG_State's
// IndexGenerator - that container's LIFO GL-name reuse is the very problem {slot, gen}
// exists to close, and the whole point of the identity is that an ABA on the GL name, on
// the heap address or on the lifetime id cannot reproduce a handle.
//
// Gen increments ONLY when a slot is reused, never on a respecify: a glBufferData on a live
// buffer keeps the same {slot, gen}, because the object is the same object. Two generations
// exist in the design and they are strictly separate - this is the client's answer to "is
// this still the same GL object"; MGGen is the server's epoch for "did I recast my driver
// object", and no MGPipe call may require the client to know it.
//
// The lifetimeId -> slot map is what keeps a GL NAME out of every key (ARCHITECTURE.md 4.2):
// the frontend object's lifetime id is the client's own identity for it, so the backend key
// is the handle and the frontend key is the lifetime id, and neither is a recyclable name.
//
// Lives in MG_Impl (the client side, unrestricted) and is compiled only under
// MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH. It is in the P2 CONTRACT commit rather than in a Track H package
// because both Track H slices - Espryt 0b and Magma subsystem 4 - key off it.
