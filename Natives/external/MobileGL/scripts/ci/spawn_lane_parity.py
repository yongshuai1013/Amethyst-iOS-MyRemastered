"""Exit gate 9.2: integration-spawn's case-name set equals integration-split's.

WHY A GATE AND NOT A COMMENT. The two lanes are registered from one macro, so today they agree
by construction - but a macro is one edit away from a second hand-written block, and a spawn lane
covering LESS than the split lane goes green while proving less. Nothing about a smaller green
lane looks wrong. This asserts the sets rather than the counts, because a count can agree while
the membership does not.

ARM PREFIXES ARE STRIPPED BEFORE COMPARING. The lanes deliberately differ in name -
`DirectGLES.Split.X` against `DirectGLES.Spawn.X` - and the sub-lane tails (`F1.`, `Ct.`) are
part of neither the case nor the arm, so both come off.

ONE SANCTIONED ASYMMETRY, LISTED HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE. `integration-split` also labels the
PUSH-MONOLITH arm (the CMakeLists explains why: the label means "the set the disaggregation gate
runs", not "runs inproc"), and that arm's scenario is monolith-only by construction. It cannot
have a spawn counterpart, so it is named as an exception rather than allowed to widen the
tolerance for everything else.

P7 PACKAGE L ADDS THE SAME QUESTION FOR MAGMA, IN TWO TIERS, AND THE NORMALISATION IS
DIFFERENT ON PURPOSE. The Espryt half above strips the sub-lane tails `F1.` and `Ct.` because
they name neither the case nor the arm. The Magma half must NOT: `RunAhead.Credit1.` and
`RunAhead.Credit3.` are two entries of the same case, differing in the credit the lane pins, and
a normaliser that dropped the tail would fold them together and then report an equal-sized set
that had silently lost one. So there the arm - and only the arm, the SECOND dotted segment - is
what comes off.

#                          process the hold never activates and the wait times out.
#   MagmaWireCacheScenario SetUp asserts runtime.transportName == "inproc" outright: the lane reads
#                          the server's own view/attachment identity out of this process.
# A cross-process hold and a cross-process cache peek are server-side knobs neither exists yet;

# P7 wave 2-B2: THE SANCTIONED ASYMMETRY THAT IS NOT INPROC-ONLY - these exist on split AND
# spawn and cannot exist on tcp. Every MGITEST_MAGMA_FORCE_* knob is read BY THE SERVER
# (WireFramebuffer.inc's getenv readers run on the apply thread), and a ctest ENVIRONMENT
# property only reaches the process ctest starts, the CLIENT. Under inproc the server is a
# thread of that process and under spawn ServerSpawn.cpp copies ::environ into the child, so
# both see it; under tcp the server is the LANE-WIDE TcpServer.Start fixture, started once from
# the fixture's own os.environ before any case runs, so nothing a per-test property says can
# reach it. A tcp copy would run the DEFAULT arm under a name claiming otherwise.
#
# MEASURED (a temporary fatal in each of the three readers): all five knob=1 entries died on
# split and on spawn and ALL FIVE PASSED on tcp.
#
# These are TAILS, not scenarios - the normaliser above keeps the sub-lane tail for the Magma
# tier on purpose, so `.MsResolve1.` names the knob entry and `.MsResolve0.` (the default, which
# does keep its tcp entry) is untouched.
#
# P7 wave 2-B3 (ID-P7-34) adds `.StaleSerial.`: MGITEST_MAGMA_FORCE_STALE_BUFFER_SERIAL is read by
# the server too (VkBufferManager.cpp), so the streamed subdata-then-draw red-once has the same
# two arms and the same tcp absence. One list, one mechanism, for every server-side knob.
# `.MsFlip1.` (B2 review round 2) is the shader-resolve knob twin of the knob-free `.MsFlip.`,
# which keeps its tcp entry.
# P7 wave 4 M2: MagmaWireReclaimScenario reads the SERVER's wbuf[] PipeStats gauges off the server's
# private log with the stats channel and MOBILEGL_IPC_WIRE_DEFERRED_MB=8 in the entry's environment -
# server-process environment again, so the same two arms and the same tcp absence. Its three cases
# are three tails (one key each) under the `.Reclaim.` prefix.
# P7 gate 5 (g5-msrbo review round, g5-msprobe): `.MsResolveBug.` / `.MsFlipBug.` set
# MGITEST_MAGMA_DEPTH_RESOLVE_PROBE=bug, which the SERVER's depth/stencil resolve arm choice reads
# in place of running its resolve probe - the knob-free `.MsResolve0.` / `.MsFlip.` keep their tcp
# entries (MsResolve0's split/spawn copies also carry a client-read expectation marker for the
# real probe's verdict, which the tcp copy cannot: same name on all three arms, no exception).
# `.MsResolveElide.` (g5-msprobe critic) sets MGITEST_MAGMA_DEPTH_RESOLVE_PROBE=elide-subject, which
# the same server-side arm choice reads to run the REAL probe with its render-pass resolve left out.
# Codex closeout finding 2 (cf-magma): the `.ImageUnitPrivate.` entries set
# MGITEST_MAGMA_FORCE_PRIVATE_IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER=1, which the SERVER's UniformManager reads to bind a
# unit-private placeholder for an invalid image unit instead of a null descriptor - the
# knob-free `.ImageUnitWindow.` copies of the same two cases keep their tcp entries. Two cases, so two
# tails (one case each), as for `.Reclaim.`.
