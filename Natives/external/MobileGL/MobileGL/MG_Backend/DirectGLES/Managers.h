    // NULL IS "ASK AGAIN", NEVER "CLEAN". Every caller treats a null answer as a reason to RUN
    // the sync, which is the direction that re-uploads rather than the direction that shows stale

    // under a live view, whatever order the application deletes the two names in. But the two
    // destroys are emitted back to back from one destructor chain, and when the view holds the
    // owner's LAST reference the member is destroyed before the view's base destructor runs, so
    // the wire carries resource_destroy(owner) and then resource_destroy(view): for one apply the
    // view record is live with Desc.ViewOf naming a freed slot. No draw can land in between, and

        //
        // WHY THIS TYPE EXISTS AT ALL. Building a driver program asks the frontend
        // ProgramObject sixteen distinct questions and asks its reflection tables thousands of
        // times, and EVERY ONE OF THEM used to be a read of client-owned memory on the apply
        // thread. Under run-ahead that is not a race to be careful about, it is wrong by
        // construction: ProgramObject::Link() REPLACES m_artifacts and m_spirv in place, and by
        // the time the server builds, the client may be several links past the one the record
        // describes. So the build reads THIS instead, and the two arms differ only in where it
        // points.
        //
        // AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT A SECOND ProgramObject. Nothing here constructs a frontend
        // object on the apply thread - ID-102's lesson, learned by id: a ProgramObject's own
        // constructor mints a lifetime id, so an "object" built server-side would trip the very
        // guards this phase installs and would make a red-once falsely green.
        //
        // THE OVERLAY IS THE OTHER HALF. Three reflection fields - the block-to-point map, the
        // sampler unit per uniform LOCATION and the name-keyed storage-block override set - are
        // members of LinkArtifacts that glUniformBlockBinding, glUniform1i and
        // glShaderStorageBlockBinding move AFTER the link that produced the archive, without
        // relinking. On the handle arm the record's set_program_bindings tails are the whole
