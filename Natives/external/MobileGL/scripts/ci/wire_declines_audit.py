"""P7 wave 2 package B3: WireDeclines.def rows and their sites must agree.

CONTRACT-P7 §0 rule I admits two shapes for a wire-arm refusal, a decline and a named Fatal.
The decline half is only real if:

  (1) every row in WireDeclines.def is actually counted somewhere - a row with no site is a
      name that can never move, which reads in a report as "this cannot happen here" when it
      only means "nobody wired it up"; and
  (2) every site emits a line - a counter with no log puts the next reader back on a bisect,
      which is the thing the package exists to remove.

Rows are APPEND-ONLY (the lanes assert specific counters), so (1) cannot be fixed later by
deleting a row once a release has shipped it. This check is why it cannot rot.

Sites reached through MGL_WIRE_DECLINE_AT satisfy both at once. A bare
WireDeclineTally::Count(WireDeclineSite::X) is allowed ONLY when an MGLOG_W/E statement stands
just above it IN THE SAME BLOCK: a line that BEGINS with the log call, at the Count line's own
indentation, with no line of lesser indentation (an enclosing `if (...) {`, a `} else {`), no
`#else`/`#elif` at any indentation and no same-indent `return`/`break`/`case`/... between
them. A log in a sibling branch or a nested one is not this site's line, neither is a guarded
one-liner (`if (g) MGLOG_W`), and neither is one compiled under anything but
`#if MOBILEGL_BUILD_DISAGGREGATED` (`#if 0`, a verbosity macro): that guard is the build this
tally exists in, and it is the ONLY conditional the block walk is fail-open for.

Everything is matched on the text with comments and string/character literals blanked out
(newlines kept, so every report cites the real line): a site or a log that is only a comment,
or only a string, is not one.
