// SCM_RIGHTS descriptor passing over an AF_UNIX socket pair. POSIX only.
//
// This is the FIRST transport commit, deliberately (inherited design, plan
// section 8.1, "SCM_RIGHTS must be implemented in the first transport
// commit"). The earlier branch pushed it to a later phase and hardcoded
// `out->fd = -1` in its offer poll, so on the only platform that matters its
// data plane could never move a byte: every segment announcement resolved to
// "no descriptor". A transport whose shm cannot cross the process boundary is
// not a transport.
//
// Channel shape: a dedicated AF_UNIX SOCK_DGRAM socketpair, NOT the control
// byte stream. Two reasons:
//   - SOCK_DGRAM preserves message boundaries on every POSIX (SOCK_SEQPACKET
//     does not exist on macOS), so one sendmsg is exactly one recvmsg and the
//     ancillary data can never be split away from its payload;
//   - ancillary data attached to a byte stream binds to whichever ordinary
//     byte happens to be at the front of the reader's buffer, which is
//     unmanageable once frames are being reassembled.
