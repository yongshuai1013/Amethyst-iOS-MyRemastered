// R-11 - THE SERVER'S OWN COPY OF THE STAGED BYTES. Owner: package v1.
//
// GLESBufferResource::hostBytes (Managers.h:839) is the tree's ONE violation of rule C ("an
// applier entry point may not hold a pointer past its return"): Ops_H_SubData (Managers.cpp:
// 1980-1983) and Ops_H_FlushRange (:2035) record the client's shadow base and six later drains
// read it (:2000, :2062, :2080, :2111, :2741, :2843). In monolith that is correct - the bytes
// belong to a frontend object that outlives the call. Under split the pointer names SEG_STAGE,
// which is valid only until retiredSeq passes the record that named it, and w1's
// MOBILEGL_IPC_AUDIT=1 fills retired staging bytes with 0xDD precisely so an implementation
// that kept the pointer is DISTINGUISHABLE from one that copied. So this copies.
//
// THE SNAPSHOT EXTENT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE RECORD DECLARED, NEVER WIDENED (the integrator's
// ruling on b1's open M-6 half). Widening looked free once before and was not: a page-aligned
// INVALIDATE_RANGE clobbered GPU-written data - an SSBO counter beside the app's SubData - with
// stale shadow bytes (Managers.cpp:1126-1129). Tier 1's INVALIDATE_RANGE is an ASSERTION that
// the old bytes are dead, so declaring bytes covered that nothing staged is not a missing
// optimisation, it is a silent data loss. The coverage set below is therefore exact, and a
// drain that reaches outside it is Fatal rather than a re-read of whatever happens to be there.
//
// WHY IT IS A HEADER AND NOT A BLOCK INSIDE Managers.cpp. Two reasons, and the second is the
// one that matters. Managers.h is package b1's, so v1's R-11 edit may not add a member to
// GLESBufferResource and the storage has to live beside it rather than in it. And a block
// inside Managers.cpp could only ever be exercised by a test that also has a GL context, a
// resource twin and a live session - which is exactly how a rule ends up with no check that
// can fail for its own reason (R-16). Here, CopiesIntoServerStorage is a parameter rather than
// a read of MG_Config::Transport, so a unit case builds one store of each kind and asserts the
// DIFFERENCE between them.
