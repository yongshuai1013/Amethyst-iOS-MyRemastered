// The bidirectional doorbell: spin briefly, then park.
//
// Both directions exist, and that is the point (inherited design, earlier plan
// section 6.2a):
//   - client -> server: the consumer spins, sets consumerParked, then blocks;
//     the producer rings only when consumerParked is set.
//   - server -> client: the client spins MOBILEGL_IPC_SPIN_US (default 50us),
//     sets producerParked, then blocks; the server rings after advancing any
//     watermark, only when producerParked is set.
// Without the second direction every client wait - present credit, a blocking
// kNeedsAck request, a full ring - degenerates into a cross-process spin on
// one shared cache line: up to a whole frame of a big core at full clock on a
// phone, fighting the GPU and the game's JVM for it. MobileGL has no affinity
// control anywhere in the tree, so it cannot even be pushed to a little core.
//
// Two implementations, no platform-specific wakeup primitive (no futex, no
// eventfd, no named event):
//   - CondVarDoorbell for `inproc` (one process, two threads),
//   - SocketDoorbell for `spawn` (one byte on a socket; POSIX only).
//
// The lost-wakeup window is closed by two seq_cst FENCES, not by the ordering
// of the park flag's own load and store:
//   - the waiter sets the flag, executes std::atomic_thread_fence(seq_cst),
//     and THEN re-tests the condition (Doorbell::Wait);
//   - the notifier publishes its watermark, executes the same fence, and THEN
//     reads the flag (NotifyIfParked).
// Both fences sit in the single seq_cst total order, so one precedes the
// other, and [atomics.order] then forces at least one side to observe the
// other's store. The flag's own accesses may be relaxed: they are not what
// closes the window.
//
// A seq_cst store paired with a seq_cst load would NOT be enough, which is
// why the fences are here and why neither may be removed. That Dekker
// argument needs all FOUR accesses in the total order, and the other two are
// not: the watermark publish is a release store (RingProducer::Publish) and
// the condition re-test is an acquire load. On x86 the gap is concrete rather
// than theoretical - a release store is a plain MOV that can still sit in the
// store buffer while the load of the park flag, also a plain MOV, reads 0, so
// the notifier skips the ring and the waiter parks on a stale watermark
// forever. (ARMv8 survives it only because STLR->LDAR is RCsc, i.e. by luck.)
//
// The other half of the contract is ordering between the caller and the
// fence: NotifyIfParked must be called AFTER the watermark is published. A
// fence only orders what precedes it.

    // THE SPIN BUDGET IS COUNTED IN ITERATIONS, NOT IN CLOCK READS.
    //
    // WHY IT CHANGED (P5d round 3, package T item 3). Wait() used to spin until
    // steady_clock passed `start + spinUs`, reading the clock once per 64 spins.
    // On the workload device a steady_clock read is a real syscall (no vDSO), and
    // simpleperf at head 56a77348 measured the GL thread paying
    // steady_clock::now() 2.34 self / 5.91 inclusive plus __kernel_clock_gettime
    // 2.37 and clock_gettime 1.94 - about 6.6% of the thread spent asking what
    // time it is, at 900+ waits per frame, for a duration that is a HINT. The
    // common case (WaitForApplied, server not yet there) paid at least two of
    // those reads per wait even when the spin succeeded on its second iteration.
    //
    // WHAT REPLACES IT. Once per process the loop measures itself: how many
    // `load(acquire)` + CpuRelax() iterations fit in a microsecond. Wait() then
    // spins `itersPerUs * spinUs` iterations and reads no clock at all; only the
    // park phase - which is about to block, so a syscall there is noise - computes
    // a deadline.
    //
    // THE OVERSHOOT BOUND, STATED HONESTLY. The old loop overshot by at most one
    // batch of 64 yields. This one overshoots by whatever the calibration was
    // wrong by, and the calibration is a single reading taken on one core at one
    // frequency:
    //   - a later DVFS drop or a migration to a little core stretches the spin by
    //     the frequency ratio (on the workload device's big/little spread that is
    //     bounded by roughly 3-4x, so a 50 us budget can become ~200 us);
    //   - a preemption inside the spin adds one scheduler slice, exactly as before;
    //   - the calibration probe does not run the caller's `ready()`, which is one
    //     or two acquire loads, so a real iteration is dearer than a probed one and
    //     the spin ends EARLY rather than late by that factor;
    //   - the clamps below cap the pathological directions: a probe that was
    //     preempted cannot produce a budget smaller than kMinSpinItersPerUs, and a
    //     probe that saw a broken clock cannot produce one larger than
    //     kMaxSpinItersPerUs.
    // None of it is a correctness bound: `ready()` is re-tested every iteration
    // and the deadline, when there is one, is still measured against the real
    // clock in the park phase. The cost of being wrong is CPU burnt before a park
    // (too long) or a park that a few more spins would have avoided (too short).
