// P7 wave 0 (plan section 1.3's P7-marked refusal row, item (0); Ph slice (2)). HOW A BACKEND DEATH REACHES
// Session::Fail WITHOUT THE BACKEND KNOWING MG_Remote EXISTS.
//
// The three Magma wire funnels - MagmaWireFatal (Renderer/WireFramebuffer.inc),
// WireDescriptorFatal (Renderer/UniformManager.cpp) and WireBufferLegacyFatal
// (Renderer/WireDraw.inc) - each logged their line and raised their OWN std::abort(). Fifteen
// P7-marked refusals (the grep key is the at-sign form, not spelled here) and two more sites die through them, and every one of those deaths:
//
//   * published NO SessionFault frame, so the peer read a bare EOF and could not name what
//     ended the session (CONTRACT-P6 5.2's whole point);
//   * bumped NO SessionFaultCount(), so exit gate S8's "zero faults over a good run" could
//     neither confirm nor falsify them;
//   * carried a HAND-TYPED family word with no path to FatalFamilies.def's projection, so
//     nothing checked that `UnmigratedVerb` in the string still meant UnmigratedVerb.
//
// Calling SessionFail() from the .inc files directly would be the obvious fix and is the wrong
// one: MG_Backend's renderer would then name an MG_Remote symbol on its own account rather than
// through the two staging headers it already borrows under `#if MOBILEGL_BUILD_DISAGGREGATED`,
// and the layering that P13's module boundaries have to establish would be one more edge worse.
//
// So the shape is MGP_TRIP_WIRE_REPORT's (PipeApply.cpp:66): MG_Pipe owns the entry point, the
// DEFAULT behaviour is exactly what the site did before (same log line, same abort), and the
// richer behaviour is a function pointer that a layer above installs. MG_Remote installs
// InstallPipeSessionFailHook() at server-role init (MG_Backend/Init.cpp's InitServerRoleCommon,
// which both the inproc server role and the spawn child run), and from then on these deaths go
// through SessionFail like every other one.
//
// THE MESSAGE STRING IS PASSED VERBATIM, family word and all - the same rule FatalFunnel.h
// states. The lines these three funnels write are already counted by name in the retrace refusal
// census and in every recorded P7-refusal measurement, so they are byte-identical before and after.

    // would silently re-point every hook call at a different family. Two words is what the three
