// The fill point (ARCHITECTURE.md 9.2, P1 brief D7). MG_Impl spells MGP_FILL(Verb); as the
// statement immediately before every call through gBackendFunctionsTable.GL - after every
// early return the call is behind, inside the loop body for a call made in a loop - so the
// frontend fills the PipeInputs block for exactly the verbs that reach a backend. In the
// pull build the macro is ((void)0) and the pull build is byte-identical to a tree without
// it.

    // PipeFill.cpp. THE VALIDATE POINT (ARCHITECTURE.md 5.1, P2 brief D1). In order:
    //   1. bump the per-verb serial, record the verb and the context identity;
    //   2. run the tracker's DIRTY WALK for this verb's class (MG_Impl/Pipe/Tracker.h);
    //   3. EMIT, for each set dirty bit whose subsystem bit is on in the runtime
    //      MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH bitmask, the P2 call that carries it;
    //   4. run the P1 residual fill for every field an emitted call did NOT supply,
    //      stamping each with the new serial exactly as before;
    //   5. in a verify build, the entry compare against a second snapshot (P1 brief D8) -
    //      which stops being a tautology the moment step 3 supplies a field step 4 skips.
    //
    // It was MGPipeFillForVerb through P1, when steps 2 and 3 did not exist. The macro
    // spelling, the 83 call sites and the verb enum are unchanged: the dispatch is

    // entry points with one call site per verb instead of nine.

    // it aborts as Fatal{UnmigratedPipeInput, "<Field>@<none>"} - which is what such a read
    // is - instead of naming whichever verb happened to be filled last. Nothing in the GL
    // entry points calls this: a real verb is always followed by the next verb's fill. It

    // in MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH, the family's own kMGPipeWired*Subsystem constant (`wired`, which
    // the caller passes because it lives in the family's emit header and this header may not
    // include one), and - for the four families P4a migrates - a backend having registered
    // MGPipeResourceOps (the same per-backend signal `MGPipeResourceSubsystemEnabled()` has
    // applied to P3a's buffers since the phase began) and every D-K2 dependency bit of the
    // family being set in the same mask.
    //
    // THE LAST TWO CONJUNCTS ARE THE ONES THIS DECLARATION EXISTS FOR, and they are the same
    // defect twice. Magma (DirectVulkan) registers no table and has no P4a twins; at a mask like
    // 0x7ff Espryt REFUSES the texture family server-side because D-K2's fourth row says bit 10
    // requires bit 11. In both cases the client emitted anyway, the applier accepted, the
    // emitters cleared their per-level dirty flags on that acceptance, and the legacy upload
    // path that still owed those texels found nothing to upload (66 DirectVulkan cases at ID-39,
    // 47 DirectGLES cases at ID-41). With them the four families emit NOTHING in that state and
    // the legacy pull path runs exactly as it does on a pull build.
    //
    // D-K2's ROWS ARE IN MG_Pipe/SubsystemDeps.def, ONCE (P3b/P4b R-5), and this comment no
    // longer restates them - restating them here is half of how the rule ended up with six
    // statements, two of which were wrong. PipeFill.cpp's kMGPipeP4aFamilyDependencies is still
    // the client's own copy and is still the bit-for-bit mirror of the four
    // `Resolve<Family>SubsystemArm()` refusals in DirectGLES/Managers.cpp; switching it to read
    // the .def is the integrator's one-line change (PipeFill.cpp is the contract package's file
    // for the whole phase, so the emitter packages do not edit it).
    // MG_Test/Backend/DirectGLES/SubsystemDepsTest.cpp drives BOTH readers at every interesting
    // mask and compares them against the .def, so the two cannot drift in the meantime.

    // AND A STALE ANSWER IS SILENT, WHICH IS WHY THAT CASE IS THE ONLY GUARD. It is tempting to
    // say a wrongly-skipped field aborts as Fatal{UnmigratedPipeInput}; it does not. The walk
    // stamps FilledGen from the verb serial whether or not it copied (PipeFill.cpp, step 4), so
    // a field the fill skips reads FRESH with the PREVIOUS verb's value - a stale binding slot
