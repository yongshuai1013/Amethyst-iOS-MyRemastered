// THE TWO ASSERTIONS THE WIRE PRODUCER'S LEDGER MAKES POSSIBLE, in one place so the scenarios
// that carry them cannot drift apart on what the numbers mean.
//
// R-10 (ExpectMaxRecordBytesUnderCap). No record may exceed
// RingProducer::MaxRecordBytes() == MOBILEGL_IPC_RING_MB / 2: the content rows cut their BLOBS
// at the stage chunk budget, so what is left uncut is the record itself, and it has to be shown
// to stay under the bound.
// Half of that proof is already a Fatal - PipeWireCodec.cpp aborts Fatal{RingOverrun} on a
// record ABOVE the cap - and it is the loud half. The quiet half is the one this assertion
// covers: the phase has to publish the MAXIMUM ACTUALLY SEEN on a real workload, so that a
// record creeping towards the cap is visible before the day it crosses. Until this landed the
// only readers of PipeWireEncoder::MaxRecordBytesSeen() were codec unit cases over synthetic
// records, and the joint gate recorded BRIEF 8 item 3 as "Maximum record bytes: NO MEASUREMENT"
// (joint-v1.md 5).
//
// R-9 / exit gate E3(e) (ExpectSmallRingWrappedAtLeastOnce). The SmallRing lane exists to run
// the reduced path over a ring small enough to force the wrap path - the kRecPad filler that
// both sides must SKIP WITHOUT ADVANCING seq, which is R-9's last clause and the one piece of
// ring behaviour no other lane reaches. It ran green from the day it was registered and proved
// nothing, because nobody counted: measured on the joint head, a whole split scenario writes
// about 40 KiB into SEG_CMD (emitseq 22-71, maxrec 784 bytes), so a 1 MiB "small" ring is 25
// times larger than the traffic and the head never comes near its wrap boundary. The lane and
// the default lane were the same run under two names - which is exactly the shape ID-53's own
// comment warned about and t1-v1.md carried as a debt ("WHAT THIS LANE DOES NOT YET ASSERT").
//
// So the lane now DRIVES ENOUGH WORK to overrun its own ring before it asserts, and the
// assertion prints the denominator with the count: "0 wraps" is a defect after 1.25 MiB through
// a 1 MiB ring and a tautology after 40 KiB, and a bare `EXPECT_GE(wraps, 1)` cannot tell those
// apart. The driving is ordinary GL - clears and draws through the scenario's own objects - and
// not a hand-built record: R-16 forbids an assertion that constructs the state it observes, and
// a test that called Reserve directly would be asserting that the ring wraps, not that the
// WORKLOAD makes it wrap.
//
// WHAT IS ASSERTED IS THE HEAD GOING ROUND, NOT THE kRecPad FILLER, and that distinction was
// forced by a measurement rather than chosen: the first cut of this assertion read the pad
// count, and 1310824 bytes of clears and draws through a 1 MiB SEG_CMD produced one and a half
// trips round the ring and ZERO pads. The reason is arithmetic, not a defect - a workload whose
// records repeat at a uniform stride that divides a power-of-two capacity lands on the boundary
// exactly, every time - so a gate written against the pad count would have been red for the
// sizes in the record catalogue and green the day one of them changed. The pad count is
// RECORDED beside the wrap count (ringpads= on the stats line, in the JUnit properties, and in
// the session's teardown ledger) so the number is available without being load-bearing.
