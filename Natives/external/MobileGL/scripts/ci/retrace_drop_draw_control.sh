# EXIT GATE E2's PICTURE CONTROL: dropping the draws on the wire must redden this retrace, and
# it must be THIS control's red.
#
# WHY THERE IS A SECOND CONTROL ON THIS LANE, and why it is the draws and not the clears.
#
# The retrace-split job already carries scripts/ci/retrace_pull_library_control.sh, which swaps a
# PULL library in and requires run_trace_case.cmake's transport-resolution assertion to catch it.
# That control proves the lane is running a SPLIT library. It does not prove that the PICTURE came
# through the wire, and it cannot: OpenRA scores ssim 1.000000 against a monolith library too, so
# the transport assertion is what reds it and the comparator is never consulted. BRIEF-P5 7 E2
# names a second, sharper statement - "patch an emitter to drop a record and the SSIM must fall
# below the threshold" - and until now nothing executed it.
#
# c1 shipped MOBILEGL_IPC_E2_DROP_CLEAR for exactly that, and the joint gate ran it and it DID NOT
# WORK: with the knob armed and its WARN in the library's own log, the OpenRA retrace under inproc
# still scored ssim=1.000000 with mismatchPixels=0 (joint-v1.md 3, "E2 clear-drop control - NOT
# VERIFIED"). That is not a broken knob. `apitrace dump` over the 31249 replayed calls counts 30
# glClear, 30 glXSwapBuffers and 788 glDrawArrays, and the final frame issues its clear at call
# 30197 and then covers the surface four times over with a terrain layer before the snapshot at
# 31249. A frame that overdraws every pixel it clears has a picture that does not depend on the
# clear. Measured here with the dropped-record count published: 29 Clear records dropped, ssim
# still 1.000000. The knob worked; the observable was invisible.
#
# So this control drops every DrawVbo record instead (MOBILEGL_IPC_E2_DROP_DRAW=1): the surface
# can then only carry the clear colour, and the golden is made of the geometry. Measured on the
# same head: 758 DrawVbo records dropped, ssim=0.000036, mismatchPixels=295296.
#
# WHAT THE CONTROL ASSERTS, and none of the three is the process exit code alone (R-16):
#   1. a NON-EMPTY selection, counted before the run - `--no-tests=error` turns an empty selection
#      into a non-zero exit, which is how ID-46 finding 8(b) got a control to congratulate itself;
#   2. the SSIM ACTUALLY FELL: the numbers are parsed out of the retrace's own summary and
#      compared, rather than "ctest was non-zero". A loader failure, a missing fixture, a timeout
#      and a Fatal{ all exit non-zero and none of them is this control's red;
#   3. the LIBRARY SAID IT DROPPED SOMETHING: its own "E2 control armed ... N records dropped on
#      the wire" line, with N > 0, from the log file the replay wrote. Without this, a knob that
#      was never read - a stale library, a variable that did not reach the process, an emit table
#      that fell through to the driver - would redden the picture for some other reason and pass.
