"""The Fatal census gate (CONTRACT-P6 5.2, exit gate S7; perimeter widened by P7 wave 0).

WHAT IT REFUSES: a `std::abort()` inside the SPLIT SERVER IMAGE that carries no family word, a
SessionFail / WireLogFatal call whose string forgot its family, a family word with no row in
FatalFamilies.def, a `Refuse{Word}` that is not a value of the wire RefuseCode, and one more
abort site than the baseline records.

S7: "a bare abort() added outside Session::Fail -> the census gate goes red". Session::Fail
EXISTS - it is SessionFail() in FatalFunnel.cpp - so a bare std::abort() is the exception this
gate refuses rather than the rule. The property it enforces is the one every downstream consumer
depends on: every death names a FAMILY, in a `Fatal{Word...}` marker, on a line a grep can find.

That is not as weak as it sounds. a6's census found the vocabulary had drifted to 30 family words
against a 7-value wire FatalCode, and found two aborts carrying no marker at all - so "the log
stays verbatim" was untrue of them and no census could see them. Everything downstream reads these
markers: run_trace_case.cmake reds a split retrace on any `Fatal{` line, the retrace lane's refusal
census counts them by name, and MEASUREMENTS quotes the distinct words. A death with no word is
invisible to all of it.

THE PERIMETER IS THE SERVER IMAGE, NOT `MG_Remote/` ALONE (P7 wave 0, plan section 1.1 row
"gate: Session::Fail site census"). CONTRACT-P6 §12.1 settles what the server image is: "P6's
server image is the whole libMobileGL.so", one flat SOURCE_FILES list feeding both roles. Until
this widening the gate scanned `MG_Remote/` and saw FOUR abort sites; the server process was
already executing seventy-nine more - 15 in DirectGLES.cpp, 12 in Managers.cpp, 11 in
VkBufferManager.cpp, 7 in PipeRoute.cpp - and every one of them was outside the gate. SCAN_ROOTS
below is the set of roots the split server actually runs code from; `.inc` joins `.cpp`/`.h`
because the Magma wire arms live in Renderer/Wire*.inc and nothing else compiles them.

TEST TREES ARE OUT. A death test's deliberate abort is not a production death, and the benchmark
and integration harnesses drive the library rather than being it.

THE SITES OF THE WIDENED PERIMETER, TRIAGED. The widening found 83; the same package routed
five of them through Session::Fail and added one funnel of its own, so the floor the baseline
records is 79 over 20 files. The triage is the argument for why the gate can be green with
seventy-nine deaths inside it. The ENFORCEABLE artefact is the baseline's per-file map - this
prose is why that map reads the way it does.

  (i)   INSIDE A SANCTIONED FUNNEL - 5 sites, and the only ones allowed to carry no marker. The
        abort is reached only through a function whose CALLERS carry the family word, so the
        death is named by the caller. FUNNEL_FILES exempts the two whole files that are nothing
        but funnel (WireLog.cpp, FatalFunnel.cpp); FUNNEL_SITES exempts the three that live
        inside a file with ordinary named deaths around them, one argued line each.
  (ii)  NAMED, AND PEER-REACHABLE - the bulk. DirectGLES.cpp 15, Managers.cpp 12,
        VkBufferManager.cpp 11, PipeRoute.cpp 7, ResourceTracker.h 5, PipeInputs.cpp 3,
        MultiDraw.cpp / SlotAllocator.cpp / BufferObject.cpp / DirectVulkan.cpp 2 each, and the
        singletons. A record the peer sent can reach these, and most already sit in a function
        that returns Bool or MobileGLResult - which is exactly why ID-P7-1 scopes their
        conversion to latch-and-decline as Ph's fuzz arm 2, AFTER P7, rather than as wave 0's.
        They carry their family word today, which is the point of widening the perimeter: the
        census can SEE them now, and the ratchet makes retiring one visible.
  (iii) NAMED, BUT NOT SESSION-SCOPED - Init.cpp's ConsumerMaskLie pair, MagmaPipeArms.h's and
        Managers.cpp's PipeLegacyMemosDisabled, DirectGLES.cpp:227's UnnamedIdentity,
        PipeFill.cpp's PipeVerify knob parser. Startup and role self-checks that predate the
        split: they die BEFORE a session exists, so routing them through SessionFail would
        publish a SessionFault to a peer that has not connected. They are named, which is what
        this gate asks of them.

WHAT THE SAME PACKAGE RETIRED, so the numbers above can be checked: StagedShadow.h:115 and
StagedTextureStore.h:344 now call SessionFail, and the three Magma wire funnels
(WireFramebuffer.inc, UniformManager.cpp, WireDraw.inc) - through which all fifteen `@P7`
refusals die - go through MG_Pipe's MGPipeSessionFail seam. Those fifteen are now visible to
every consumer of the funnel: a SessionFault frame for the peer, a SessionFaultCount() for exit
gate S8, and a family word that FatalFamilies.def projects.

THE FOUR RULES, spelled out rather than inferred:

  1. an abort's `Fatal{Word` marker is within kMarkerWindow lines above it, OR the abort is
     exempted by FUNNEL_FILES / FUNNEL_SITES;
  2. every WireLogFatal / SessionFail / SessionLatch call carries a `Fatal{` in its format string -
     a funnel that accepted an unmarked string would launder exactly what rule 1 refuses (PH-1 (3)
     added SessionLatch, the per-session latch-or-die twin of SessionFail);
  3. every family word found in the perimeter has a row in FatalFamilies.def. a6's finding was a
     30-word vocabulary against a 7-value wire enum; the .def is the projection that bounds the
     divergence, and a word with no row projects onto nothing at all;
  4. every `Refuse{Word}` names a value of protocol.fbs's RefuseCode enum. This is rule 3 for the
     handshake's vocabulary, and it exists because `Refuse{AuthenticationRequired}` was in the
     tree for a whole phase naming an enumerator that has never existed (PH-7 (2)).

THE BASELINE IS A DOWNWARD RATCHET ON ABORT SITES AND AN UPWARD ONE ON WORDS. More abort sites
than the baseline records is a failure that names the file(s) that grew; fewer is the direction
the P7 `@P7` retirements move and only asks to be re-baselined in the same commit. The family set
may grow, but never unrecorded: the wire's FatalCode has seven values while the internal
vocabulary is six times that, and the divergence is the thing 5.2's funnel exists to bound.
