// Push-on-mutation (P1 lane finding F2). MGP_FILL copies a verb's may-read set out of the
// live GLContext at the verb boundary; the backend then reads that copy for the whole verb.
// A backend that WRITES a frontend object inside its own verb - Magma synthesising a
// fallback texture for an unbound sampler, materialising a queued clear, or overriding a
// sampler's filter - moves a value the boundary already copied, and every read after that
// point sees a block that no longer equals the live context. That is a real divergence, not
// a harness artefact: the pull build reads the moved value and the push build does not.
//
// The frontend mutator that moves such a value spells MGP_NOTE_MUTATION(Field) right where
// it moves it. The notice refreshes that ONE field in the pushed block when the field
// belongs to the verb currently in flight, so "the pushed block equals the live context at
// every read" stays literally true and the push build keeps pull semantics. It refreshes
// the value only and never the poison stamp, so a withheld stamp (MOBILEGL_PIPE_POISON_OMIT,
// negative control B) stays withheld.
//
// In the pull build the macro is ((void)0) and this header includes nothing, so the pull
// build is byte-identical to a tree without it.

    // redundant SECOND path that must be idempotent - which it is, because it resolves through
    // the same lifetimeId -> slot map these free, and MGPipeSlotAllocator::Free refuses a slot
    // that is not live at that generation.
    //
    // THE ORDER INSIDE EACH IS FIXED AND IS NOT A PACKAGE'S CHOICE:

    //   2. raise NotifyStateObjectDestroyed SECOND - it resolves the handle through the
    //      allocator, and a backend told after the Free could no longer find its twin, which
    //      moves the leak from the client to the driver object;
    //   3. free the slot LAST, and a double free on a stale generation is a proven no-op

    // forward-declaring for any of them.

    // slot with the applier's record still Live, on a slot about to be handed out again. The
