// P5e (MG_Remote/CONTRACT-P5E.md §2.1): MGPipeBarriered takes an MGPWireOp and reads the

// header in the same layer - MG_Pipe includes MG_Pipe - so the closure does not move.
#include "MGPipe.h"

// The in-process applier: the SERVER half of the calls P2 emits. Under split this file is
// MG_Remote/Server/PipeApplier (ARCHITECTURE.md 8.3); in the monolith it writes
// MG_Backend/MGPipe/PipeInputs' gPipeInputs directly, so a call and its effect are one
// function call apart and nothing is serialised.
//
// THE SERVER'S PER-CONTEXT WORKING BLOCK *IS* PipeInputs::m_renderState. bind_render_state
// and set_dynamic_state scatter their chunks straight into it, which is why DirectGLES'
// SyncRenderState is not one line changed (ROADMAP.md P2, G5): the block Espryt binds by
// const reference is the assembled block. It is also what makes the MOBILEGL_PIPE_VERIFY
// comparator a real oracle instead of a tautology - the compare-at-read now proves
// "assembled == live", field by field, at every backend read.
//
// This header FORWARD-DECLARES PipeInputs rather than including it: the applier's callers
// (MG_Impl/Pipe) already have it, and MG_Pipe sits below MG_Backend.
//
// Compiled only under MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH (CMakeLists.txt), so the pull build gains no symbol.
// P4a: create_shader_state carries the reflection ARCHIVE, and in monolith the archive does
// not travel - the two structs ride beside the record through the entry point's companion
// pointers, exactly as P3a's `const void* initialBytes` does (D-H3, the one Blob rule). So
// this header needs their NAMES and never their definitions; the forward declaration is the
// whole coupling and the closure gate is what keeps it one. The verify build is the only
// place the codec runs, and it runs from PipeApply.cpp.
// P5e (pg) ADDS A THIRD NAME AND KEEPS THE RULE: ProgramArchive is what a SPLIT create carries
// - the record's OWN copy of both structs plus the stage of each module - and the record holds
// it through a SharedPtr, which needs no definition either (the deleter is captured where the
// archive is constructed, in the decoder's TU). So the coupling is still three names and no
// closure change, and MG_Backend, which does need the definition, includes
// ProgramArtifactsCodec.h for it.

    // discarded the call, a dead or stale handle (a counted no-op) and a corrupt record (a Fatal
    // that deliberately moves no counter) are all invisible from the call site, so a client that

    // returns it, and so must the two calls that DEFINE the storage a subsequent upload lands
    // in - a create or a respecify the applier refused leaves no record for the upload to
    // accumulate onto, and B's own bookkeeping (its per-entry descriptor dedupe, its drain list)
    // must not advance past a call that never landed.
    //
    // ALL THREE ARE SOURCE-COMPATIBLE: a Bool return is ignorable, P3a's call sites in
    // MG_Impl/Pipe/PipeFill.cpp discard it, and gen_pipe.py never parses this header - the wire

    // (uploadTarget, level) as well (MG_State/GLState/TextureState/TextureObject.h), so a

    // A METADATA RESPECIFY IS A RESPECIFY THAT REDEFINES NO STORAGE (ID-18 M4). A sticky
    // BindMask / ImageBindableHint bit reaches the applier only on a respecify, and an
    // IMMUTABLE texture has no further one - that is what immutable means - so the canonical
    // order (glTexStorage2D, then glBindImageTexture or an FBO attachment) would leave the
    // record's hint at 0 for ever, and the hint is the PREVENTION half of the texture-remint
    // stall class. So B re-emits the descriptor when the mask moves, and a record whose
    // STORAGE-DEFINING fields all equal the stored descriptor's is applied as a metadata
    // update:

    //     rather than contradicting it: that rule drops the uploads against the storage a
    //     respecify REPLACES, and a call that replaces no storage replaces no coordinate system
    //     either, so there is nothing to drop. A mask change arriving between a
