// THE CLIENT -> WIRE ROUTING OF THE 38 MGPipeApply* ENTRY POINTS (P5, integrator ruling R-17;
// 38 since P5c rv added set_context_values, CONTRACT-P5C.md section 5.3).
// Owner: package c1.
//
// WHAT WAS MISSING. `gMGPipeWireRecordApply` is the DECODE hook and it has existed since w1:
// a record arrives, `PipeWireCodec` picks it apart and calls `MGPipeApply<Name>`. There was no
// encode twin. Every `MG_Impl/Pipe` emitter called `MGPipeApply<Name>` DIRECTLY, so under
// `MOBILEGL_TRANSPORT=inproc` every resource, CSO, texture and program record still executed
// synchronously on the GL thread against a context v1 is moving to the apply thread - where
// all sixteen `IsBackendContextCurrentOnThisThread()` and sixteen `CanTouchGLNow()` guards
// answer false. `ClearThenReadPixels` might have survived that; `TriangleScenario` needs a VBO
// and a program and could not.
//
// The two generated tables (`gMGPipeScreen`, `gMGPipeContext`, `generated/PipeTables.inc`) are
// the boundary this repository already had, and they were never installed - every entry null,
// which `MGPipe.h` correctly calls "precisely the pre-migration state". R-17 installs them.
// This header is the frontend-facing half: the names `MG_Impl/Pipe` calls, and the mechanism
// that gets a kReplySlot row's answer back to its call site.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE SIZE OF R-17, MEASURED RATHER THAN ESTIMATED
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// R-17 costed this as "37 thin client emitters over EmitAndWait". The emitters are thin. The
// ROUTING was not, and the reason is that the generated table signature is the P2-era monolith
// interface: `void (*Name)(const Payload* payload, ...)`, async-with-handle, no return value,
// and NO COMPANION POINTER. Of the 37 entry points, as the tables stood:
//
//     24  the row could carry every argument the call site passes today
//     13  it could not
//
// The thirteen split three ways, and only one of the three is a generator question:
//
//  (a) NINE carry a blob companion - `chunkBytes`, `blobBytes`, `parameters`, `bytes`,
//      `initialBytes` - which is CONTRACT-P5 table 1's "companion pointer today" column. A
//      kVarTail row already gains `const void* varTail, Uint32 varTailCount`; a kHasBlob row
//      gained nothing. THE GENERATOR CHANGE IS THAT ONE ASYMMETRY, and nothing else: five
//      lines in `Call.Signature` giving a kHasBlob row `const void* blobBytes, Uint64
//      blobByteCount`. Ten rows gained the pair (the nine plus `GetCaps`, which has no applier
//      entry point). `--check` up to date, `--self-test` 9/9 trips.
//
//  (b) FOUR return a value the row cannot: `ResourceCreate`, `ResourceRespecify`,
//      `ResourceSubData` and `SetTextureParams` return Bool and `MapPersistent` returns void*.
//      These are exactly CONTRACT-P5 §2's reply-slot rows, and R-5 forbids re-deriving any of
//      them on the client. The answer therefore has to come back THROUGH the reply slot, which
//      is what `MGPipeTakeReply*` below is, and it is the part of R-17 that no amount of
//      "thin emitter" covers: `MGPReplySlot` is `{Uint64 Id;}` - an IDENTIFIER, not a value -
//      so a reader had to exist for the identifier to be worth minting.
//
//  (c) FOUR CANNOT GO THROUGH A GENERATED ROW AT ALL, and each one is a contract ruling
//      rather than an oversight. They are the ESCAPES below. Saying "four" out loud is the
//      honest answer to "tell me if it is bigger than it looks": it is, by four rows and one
//      reply-reading mechanism.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE REPLY MAILBOX, AND WHY ONE ENTRY IS THE RIGHT DEPTH
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `MGPReplySlot` carries an id; the answer lands beside it. The mailbox is ONE ENTRY DEEP and
// thread-local, and that is not a simplification - it is R-1's verb barrier stated as a data
// structure. While the barrier holds, the in-flight depth is exactly one (`ReplySlot.h`:
// "under R-1's verb barrier the in-flight depth is one"), so a second posting before the first
// is taken is not a capacity problem, it is a barrier that has stopped working. It Fatals.
//
// THE MAILBOX HAS NO DEFAULT ANSWER AND THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT. `MGPipeTakeReplyBool` on a
// slot nothing posted to is `Fatal{ReplyMissing, "<row>"}`, not `false` and emphatically not
// `true`. "Always accept" is ID-39's 66 lost DirectVulkan uploads with a wire in between, and
// "always refuse" is an emitter that re-sends for ever. A row that forgets to answer is a bug
// that must be impossible to ship, so it is impossible to READ.
//
// WHEN THE BARRIER RETIRES (R-1 opens family by family) this becomes a real slot pool keyed on
// seq, which is what `Transport::ReplySlot` already is on the wire side. The mailbox is the
// frontend-side handle onto it and nothing else; it is deliberately NOT a second id space,
// because the split arm stamps the record's own seq into `MGPReplySlot::Id` (R-3).

    // A hand-written third table, installed and uninstalled by the same two functions as the

    // applier's own, because that is the shape the monolith arm has to reproduce byte for
    // byte (G2), and each row is here for a ruling that is written down:
    //
    //   ResourceRespecify  `initialBytes` has NO kHasBlob and R-13.3 forbids giving it one
    //                      ("initialBytes is always nullptr under split; initial content
    //                      arrives as ResourceSubData records immediately after this one").
    //                      So the row is correct to omit it AND monolith must still pass it.
    //   ResourceFlushRange `bytes` likewise, by R-13.2, and for a sharper reason: a blobref
    //                      here would be "a second, forgeable way to say the same thing".
    //   MapPersistent      `size` and `seedBytes` have no carrier at all - `MGPHandleOnly` is
    //                      {Handle, Kind} - and the call returns void*. R-6 makes the split
    //                      answer a constant DECLINE, so the carrier is not needed; the
    //                      monolith arm needs both arguments.
    //   CreateShaderState  SEVEN blobrefs (`Spirv[6]` + `Reflection`) and TWO typed frontend
    //                      pointers. One `blobBytes` pair cannot express seven runs, and
    //                      serialising under monolith to un-serialise in the adapter would put
    //                      `EncodeProgramArtifacts` on the monolith path, which `PipeApply.h`
    //                      explicitly promises it is not ("zero serialisation cost on the
    //                      monolith path").
    //   SetProgramBindings THREE tails in three index spaces plus a PARALLEL NAME ARRAY
    //                      (P5e, MG_Remote/CONTRACT-P5E.md §1/§5.5). One `varTail` +
    //                      `varTailCount` pair cannot express three runs at all, and the
    //                      fourth argument is not a run: the storage-override key is a
    //                      `MGHostSpan` on the wire and a plain `const char*` under monolith,
    //                      so the applier takes the resolved names beside the tail rather
    //                      than resolving segments itself (rule C - a span retires with the
    //                      record that named it, and the applier copies the bytes it keeps).
    //                      The generated `gMGPipeContext.SetProgramBindings` row therefore
    //                      STAYS NULL, which is what PipeCatalogueTest already pins.
