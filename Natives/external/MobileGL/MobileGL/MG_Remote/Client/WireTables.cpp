// The ENCODE TWIN of gMGPipeWireRecordApply: thirty-eight emitters that turn a table call into
// a wire record. Owner: package c1 (P5 ruling R-17). See WireTables.h for the install order
// and MG_Pipe/PipeRoute.h for what R-17 actually cost.
//
// EVERY EMITTER IS THE SAME FOUR STEPS, and the macros below exist so that a reader can check
// thirty-eight rows against PipeTables.inc in one pass instead of reading thirty-eight bodies:
//
//     1. require a session - a slot that fell through to a driver this role does not have is
//        the failure R-4 exists to prevent, and there is no fall-through here either;
//     2. stage the blob, if the row has one, and name the SEG_STAGE run in the payload's own
//        MGPBlobRef - which is why the payload is COPIED: the table hands it over const, and
//        the blobref is the one field the client must write after the caller is done with it;
//     3. EmitAndWait, which is the barrier's wait and the reply's wait at once (R-3/R-5);
//     4. post the answer, for the rows that have one, into MG_Pipe's reply mailbox.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. b1's `PushPersistentMapsBeforeVerb` / `MarkGpuWritesFor*` are
// NOT called from these thirty-eight. They are pre-VERB hooks and these are not verbs: they
// are the resource, CSO and state records that a verb is later drawn against. The five class-B
// verbs in EmitTables.cpp call them, once each, immediately before their record, which is the
// ordering b1's B-1 fix depends on. Calling them here as well would push a persistent map
// before every `set_dynamic_state` - hundreds of times a frame, and each one a real record.

    // TABLE 3's ROLE SPLIT, AS A RUNTIME CHECK. gMGPipeScreen / gMGPipeContext are PROCESS
    // globals and under `inproc` the server role is a thread in this same process, so the
    // apply thread running the server's own backend - the EGL bring-up, InitCapabilities,
    // the applier - reaches these very emitters. A record published there would be waited
    // for by the thread that is supposed to apply it: `Fatal{BarrierTimeout,
    // "ResourceRespecify"}` from `mgl-srv-apply` one barrier budget into bring-up, which is
    // exactly how this was found.
    //
    // THE ANSWER IS NOT "SUPPRESS THE RECORD" - it is "run the server's own code", because
    // on that thread this process IS the server and the applier is one call away. It is
    // the same thing PipeWireCodec does on the decode side, where every arm calls
    // MGPipeApply* directly and never goes through a table.
    //
    // Under `spawn` (P6) the predicate is constantly false in the client process and
    // constantly true in the server's, so this costs one atomic load and changes nothing.
    //
    // NOT in the anonymous namespace, because M5 needs it from MG_Impl/Pipe/PipeFill.cpp too
    // (its split-only respecify/flush branches must not run on the apply thread). Declared in
    // WireTables.h.
    //
    // AND IT STAYS OUT OF LINE (P5d round 3, package D). OnApplyThread() became an inline
    // relaxed load plus a thread-pointer compare in ServerLoop.h, so the body this forwards to
    // is now smaller than the call that reaches it - but inlining THIS would mean including a
    // server header from WireTables.h, and the declaration above exists precisely so PipeFill
    // does not have to. One PLT hop per verb is the price of that boundary; the four-part
    // predicate behind it, which was the measured cost (2.66% self on the client thread at
    // head 56a77348), is gone either way. The "one atomic load" the paragraph above promised
