"""The dirty-surface scanner (plan B corollary 4, section 5.2).

MGPipe replaces "the backend rediscovers what changed" with "the frontend says what
changed", which only works if EVERY frontend mutation that a backend can observe bumps an
aggregate generation. The failure mode is silent and one-directional: a mutation that
forgets to bump renders stale, and no purity gate can see it.

So the mutation surface has to be enumerated mechanically rather than by memory. This
script reports every place in MG_Impl/GLImpl where a GL entry point BOTH mutates frontend
state through pGLContext AND reaches the backend in the same function - those are the
publish points, the ones that must map onto an aggregate generation.

P3a widens the scan root to MG_State/GLState as well, and with it reads the OTHER publish
mechanism: MGP_NOTE_MUTATION, which a state object spells when it moves a pushed PipeInputs
field from inside a backend's own verb. Those sites carry a FIELD name rather than a mutator
name and none of them is a `pGLContext->` call, so the scan attributes each to its ENCLOSING
function - which is the name a DirtySurface.def row is written against. Until this, the four
in TextureState.h were outside the gate entirely, which is the one of the three blind spots
P2 recorded that a scan can actually close.

P0 is the skeleton: it reports. P1 adds the mapping file and CI regenerates it with
`git diff --exit-code` and zero unmapped mutators, the same shape as gen_pipe.py's G6.

P2 adds the half a completeness gate cannot have: for the RenderState family the ANSWER is
derived from RenderState.cpp rather than believed, so a row that names a publisher which
fires on only some paths through the setter (or omits one that always fires) is red. Without
it a row could be wrong in exactly the direction ARCHITECTURE.md 13.2 calls dangerous while
--check stayed green, which is how two rows in this mapping were wrong for a whole review.

Every other bit answer is derived too, against the shutter Tracker.h builds for that bit.
That derivation makes an ABSENCE claim ("this mutator writes nothing that shutter reads"),
so it is only as good as the code it reads, and twice it was not: it missed the writes that
go through a member's field or through the preprocessor, and then - once it read those - it
resolved the reader side to a whole struct while the writer side resolved to the struct's
fields, so every setter of RenderState.cpp "supported" the patch-state bit. Both halves now
resolve to the SAME two-level token, MEM:<member> plus FIELD:<member>.<leaf>; a reference or
pointer bound to a member-rooted lvalue is followed; and a write whose root the analysis
cannot resolve to a member TAINTS the function, so every answer that depends on it comes
out UNDECIDED - printed, tallied, never a verdict. A match at the member level with no
field information on one side is COARSE, reported separately and never counted as derived.

#
# P4a WIDENS IT BY EXACTLY TWO WORDS, `Use` and `Bind`, and the hole they close is a coverage
# hole in this heuristic rather than a red gate that was being ignored: `UseProgram` begins
# with "Use" and `BindVertexArray`, `BindProgramPipelineObject` and `BindTransformFeedbackObject`
# begin with "Bind", so none of the four was ever visible to this scan - and each of them moves
# a field P3a or P4a pushes. The complete set the widening surfaces was enumerated by grep at
# the phase's base ref before the change landed, so it is four names on seven call sites and
# not a discovery.
#
# `Create` and `Pop` are DELIBERATELY NOT ADDED; DirtySurface.def's header carries the reason,
# which is that they create or destroy objects rather than move a pushed field, and each
# object class's creation and destruction is already answered by its own Mark*ForDeletion row
# plus the constructor-time resource_create.
# P5e WIDENS IT BY ONE MORE WORD, `Touch`, and the hole it closes is the same coverage hole
# `Use` and `Bind` closed at P4a. `GLContext::TouchBufferBindingPoint` is the high-water mark
# every indexed-binding-point walk is bounded by - the backend's, the client's GPU-write sweep's
# and, since P5e, set_shader_buffers' emitted window - so a call that moves it moves the SIZE of
# a pushed record, and none of the three sites that call it was visible to this scan because
# none begins with one of the twelve words the pattern matched. The complete set the widening
# surfaces was enumerated by grep before the change landed: ONE name on two call sites, both in

# ---- the OTHER answers, derived from the shutter each bit is built out of ---------------
# The render-state derivation above covers 45 of the 73 rows. For the rest, "does this
# mutator move the shutter it names" is still a mechanical question, just one asked of a
# different pair of files: MG_Impl/Pipe/Tracker.h says which counters and which bytes each
# MGPipeDirty bit compares, and MG_State says who moves those. So:
#
#   1. read Tracker.h's Update() and, per bit, collect what its shutter READS - ctx.GetXxx()
#      accessors, and `local.Field` reads of a walk local that holds an accessor's result;
#   2. resolve each read, through MG_State's one-line getters, to the same TWO-LEVEL TOKEN
#      the writer side uses: MEM:<member>, and FIELD:<member>.<leaf> - `render.PatchVertices`
#      is FIELD:m_parameters.PatchVertices, and an accessor that returns a whole member reads
#      every field of it, FIELD:<member>.*;
#   3. walk every function body under MG_State/GLState and MG_Impl/Pipe and compute, as a
#      fixed point over call names, which two-level tokens each one transitively WRITES -
#      including through MGP_NOTE_AGGREGATE, whose per-aggregate hop is read out of
#      MGPipeNoteAggregate's own switch rather than assumed;
#   4. match: a writer SUPPORTS a bit iff it writes a member the shutter reads AND, both sides
#      being field-resolved for that member, their FIELD sets intersect (a whole-member write
#      or read is every field). A member in common with no field information on one side is
#      COARSE. UNDER-FIRING - the red verdict - only when every member the shutter reads is
#      either unwritten by the mutator or written in disjoint fields, both sides resolved.
#
# STEP 4 IS AN ABSENCE CLAIM, so step 3 must not MISS a write and must not CREDIT one it did
# not read. What it models is written down here, and what it does not model taints the
# function it is in, which turns every answer depending on that function into UNDECIDED:
#
#   modelled  ++m_x / m_x = / m_x op= (a whole-member write: MEM:m_x, FIELD:m_x.*); a write
#             through a member-rooted lvalue (m_x.f, m_x[i].f, m_x->f, nested), which records
#             MEM:m_x and FIELD:m_x.f - the first field below the member, deeper paths
#             collapse to it, because that is the granularity the shutter reads at; a
#             reference or pointer bound to a member-rooted lvalue (auto& r = m_x.f;
#             for (auto& e : m_x.arr); T* p = &m_x.f; a pointer REBOUND by p = &m_x.g, every
#             binding counting; an alias of an alias), whose writes record the root member
#             and the path they were bound to; a write through a call that returns a
#             reference into an lvalue (m_x.f() = v), a member-function call on a
#             member-rooted lvalue (m_x.push_back(), m_x.reset(), m_x.f.clear()) and a
#             memcpy/memset/memmove/swap whose destination is one, all credited as a whole
#             write of that lvalue - a read-only call is over-credited, which only WIDENS the
#             writer side; a write to a value local, a by-value parameter or an aggregate
#             initialiser's `.f = v`, which touch no member; a write through a const alias
#             with `.` or through a const raw pointer, which the language forbids - but `->`
#             through a const REFERENCE may be a smart pointer's and is NOT taken as
#             read-only; MGP_NOTE_AGGREGATE; a call to any function whose body is under the
#             two roots, resolved BY NAME (every body of that name); and any function-like
#             macro defined under the two roots, EXPANDED first, token pasting performed.
#   tainted   a write, or a non-read-only method call, through a reference or pointer
#             PARAMETER; through a local reference, pointer or iterator bound to something
#             that is not a member-rooted lvalue (a call result, a ternary, an arithmetic
#             expression); to or on a name the body never declares (a member without the m_
#             prefix, a global, an unexpanded token); an assignment operator the analysis
#             could not attribute to any lvalue at all; a `##` left after macro expansion;
#             and a call to a token-pasting macro it refused to expand. Nothing is trusted
#             by name except the standard library's size()/begin()/find() family. The taint
#             is a token like every other, so it travels the same call-graph fixed point the
#             writes do: a mutator that REACHES a tainted body gets no verdict either.
#   undecided also when the shutter itself reads something this script cannot resolve to a
#             member, when the mutator has no body under the two roots, and - for the absence
#             direction only - when a member the shutter reads has a write-shaped occurrence
#             OUTSIDE the two roots. --check prints every UNDECIDED pair with its reason, and
#             fails on one that DirtySurface.def does not list as known-undecided.
#
# What remains one-directional is the OTHER direction: a call name resolves to every body of
# that name, a write inside an `if` counts, a reader that resolves through a ternary yields
# both members, a FIELD token is not scoped to a type - so "M does write something B reads"
# is not proof that it does so on every path and cannot become a MISSING check without false
# reds. That is why a mutator whose bit moves on half its arms answers kPulledPartialShutter
# rather than the bit. "M writes NOTHING B reads" is the direction the gate fails on, and it
# is the under-firing one ARCHITECTURE.md 13.2 calls dangerous - which is what was wrong in
# this file: X(SetNamedTransformFeedbackBinding, NEW_SO_TARGETS) named a shutter that moves
# on NO path through that mutator.
