// P5 package c1: the 71-slot emit table.
//
// THE PARTITION IS CONTRACT-P5.md §7's AND IS NOT RE-DERIVED HERE (R-15, ID-12):
//   class A  2 slots  answered locally from the caps mirror, never emitted, never Fatal
//   class B 54 slots emitted; class C 15 slots name their unmigrated verb.
// The three counts are static_asserted to sum to kRemoteEmitSlotCount below, so a slot that
// changes class without changing the arithmetic is a build break rather than a behaviour
// change nobody reviewed.
//
// P5b MOVES SLOTS FROM C TO B, ONE PACKAGE AT A TIME (MG_Remote/CONTRACT-P5B.md §7). The three
// numbers above are the partition AT THE P5b CONTRACT COMMIT and they are the ones the contract
// states; the arithmetic below is what the tree currently has, and the per-package ownership
// assertions say which package moved which slot. On this head t2 has landed: class B is 5 + 6
// and class C is 58.
//
// THE PRE-VERB HOOKS RUN BEFORE THE RECORD, NEVER AFTER (b1, ID-18). PushPersistentMapsBeforeVerb
// publishes the bytes an application wrote through a coherent map with no API call at all, and
// MarkGpuWritesForDraw builds the conservative GPU-write set the client now owns. Both describe
// the work the record is ABOUT TO START, so a hook deferred past its own record is the C-1
// regression re-committed at the transport layer.

        // E2 RETRACE RED (joint-v1.md 3: SSIM 1.000000, mismatchPixels=0 with the knob armed and
        // the arming WARN in the library's own log). That is not a broken knob, it is OpenRA:
        // `apitrace dump` of openra.trace over the 31249 replayed calls counts 30 glClear, 30
        // glXSwapBuffers and 788 glDrawArrays, and the final frame issues its clear at call
        // 30197 and then covers the surface four times over with a terrain layer
        // (`glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, first=56064, count=16128)` x4, under a scissor of
        // -24,-24,688x528 over a 640x480 surface) before the snapshot at 31249. A frame that
        // overdraws every pixel it clears has a picture that does not depend on the clear, so
        // "drop the clear" is a control whose observable is invisible to THIS trace - R-16's
        // exact defect, a gate that cannot go red for its own reason.
        //

        // drop every DrawVbo record and the picture can only be the clear colour. It is the
