// Scenario - NEGATIVE CONTROL B (gate G5): AN OMITTED FILL POINT ABORTS ON THAT VERB, AND ONLY THERE.
//
// The per-verb poison is the half of P1 that makes a forgotten fill row loud instead of silent: the
// filler stamps a generation on every field it copies for a verb, and an accessor whose stamp is not
// this verb's aborts with Fatal{UnmigratedPipeInput, "<Field>@<Verb>"}. A mechanism that can only be
// observed when someone forgets a row is a mechanism nobody can trust, so MOBILEGL_PIPE_POISON_OMIT
// forges the mistake on purpose: it names one (verb, field) pair whose STAMP the filler skips while
// still copying the value, which is indistinguishable from a row that was never written.
//
// The scenario asserts both halves of "on THAT verb, and only there":
//
//   OmittedFieldAbortsOnThatVerb - with MOBILEGL_PIPE_POISON_OMIT=GenerateMipmap:GetActiveTextureUnit,
//                                  a draw must still complete (GetActiveTextureUnit is not in kDraw's
//                                  mask, and the draw's own fields are stamped normally) and the
//                                  following glGenerateMipmap must abort naming exactly that pair.
//   WithoutOmissionCompletes     - the identical sequence with the knob unset runs to completion with
//                                  no Fatal at all. Without this half, "it aborted" would say nothing
//                                  about WHY: a poison that fired on every verb would look just as red.
//
// The knob is process-wide, so the two cases cannot share a lane: the first runs in the PoisonOmitted.
// entries, the second in the ambient Verify. entries (it skips when the knob IS set).
//
// WHY THE SEQUENCE RUNS IN A SEPARATE PROCESS, AND WHY THAT PROCESS IS fork()+execve() AND NOT fork()
// ALONE. The poison reports with MGLOG_F and then std::abort(), in the middle of a GL command - so the
// sequence cannot run in the test process, and the harness's own bring-up pre-flight
// (Harness/HeadlessGL.cpp) already establishes the shape: run it where a SIGABRT is a datum in
// waitpid() instead of a dead lane. But that pre-flight forks BEFORE any context exists, and this case
// cannot: the fixture has already brought one up. A bare fork() of a process holding a live Vulkan
// device inherits the driver's mutexes with no threads to release them, and the child wedges on its
// first submit - measured here as a 120s timeout on DirectVulkan and a clean pass on DirectGLES, which
// is exactly the kind of backend-shaped flake a control must not have. So the child immediately
// execve()s a fresh copy of this same test binary, filtered to the worker case below, which brings up
// its own context from scratch and knows nothing about the parent's.
//
// The child gets its OWN MOBILEGL_LOG_FILE_PATH for the same reason: the library opens its log with
// fopen(path, "w"), so a child sharing the parent's path would truncate the file the parent is about
// to read.

        // not - since P5c hd the server's generate_mipmap resolves the texture from the verb's own
        // handle (MGPipeApplier().VerbMipRes) and never reads the active unit - so omitting that
        // stamp is omitting a stamp nobody reads, and the child exits 0 (measured on
        // integration-verify-split, both backends). ReadPixels:GetPixelStoreParameters is the
