// The client half of a session: the rings, the handshake, the verb barrier. Owner: package s1
// (construction and handshake) with c1 (the barrier and the reply read). Signatures by c0.
//
// INPROC USES ShmSegment AND THE RING, NOT new[] AND NOT InProcessTransport's deques. That is
// half of what "inproc runs the same G3 codec as spawn" means: InProcessTransport
// (InProcessTransport.cpp:38-97) is two deque<vector<uint8_t>> plus two condvar doorbells, it
// touches neither a ring nor a codec, and building the session on top of it instead of on top
// of the ring would make the whole phase unfalsifiable. The transport supplies the two
// DOORBELLS and the control plane; the records go through SEG_CMD.
//
// THE VERB BARRIER (R-1). After emitting a verb the client blocks until
// RingControl::appliedSeq >= the seq it just got back from the encoder. It is not caution: 31
// of the 63 PipeInputs fields are still filled by the client's residual pass out of a live
// GLContext, so an unbarriered queue lets the server read a FUTURE value of them. Two
// consequences that must be stated because both are load-bearing:
//   - while the barrier holds, at most one of {GL thread, apply thread} is runnable, which is
//     what makes a single process-wide gPipeInputs legal (table 3);
//   - the barrier is a RETIRING object, not a design. It opens family by family as table 2's
//     BARRIER-PULLED column empties, and each later package reports how many rows it left.
//
// THE BARRIER'S WAIT IS ALSO THE REPLY'S WAIT (R-3/R-5). The reply slot id IS the record seq,
// so "wait for appliedSeq >= mySeq" and "wait for my answer" are one wait and the four Bool
// acceptance returns, ReadPixels' pixels and MapPersistent's decline cost ZERO extra round
// trips. The client MUST NOT re-derive any of those four answers locally - that is the c0f/c0g
// defect P4a paid two contract corrections for, and "always accept" is ID-39's 66 lost uploads.
