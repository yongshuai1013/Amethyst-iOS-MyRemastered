// The CLIENT side of P3a's resource family (brief D-A, D-B, D-C, D-D).
//
// WHERE IT RUNS, and it is the ONE exception to push-at-validate (ARCHITECTURE.md 5.1):
// the seven BufferBackendOps hooks already dispatch at the GL call that causes them, so
// their pipe calls are emitted from the same BufferObject dispatchers - not from
// MGPipeValidateForVerb. Nothing about buffers moves to validate time in P3a.
//
// WHAT LIVES HERE
//   * the sticky BindMask, one constexpr BufferTarget -> bit table with a static_assert
//     that it covers every enumerator, so a new target cannot be silently unmapped;
//   * the lifetimeId -> {slot, gen} mint (through MGPipeSlots(), the one allocator) and
//     the slot -> BufferObject* INVERSE the reverse channel resolves a writeback through;
//   * the nine MGPipeEmitResource* bodies, declared in MG_Pipe/PipeMutation.h so that
//     MG_State sees a declaration and never this file (the same layering PipeMutation.h
//     already has for MGP_NOTE_MUTATION: declare in MG_Pipe, define in MG_Impl);
//   * the MGPSubData range splitter, because one record's box caps the destination at a
//     2^31-1 offset and a 2^32-1 size;
//   * the map-persistent-roundtrips counting site.
//
// HEADER-ONLY, for the ownership reason Tracker.h states in full: the root CMakeLists.txt
// that would name a new .cpp belongs to the contract package and is frozen behind the tag.
// MG_Impl/Pipe/PipeFill.cpp is the one translation unit that includes it in the library.
//
// NO TIMER, and no per-call record copy on a HOT path. The two observables a unit case
// needs - the last emitted descriptor and the per-call counts - are written only by
// resource_create and resource_respecify, which run once per glBufferData rather than per
// upload; resource_subdata, the hot one, is observed through the pure builders below
// instead (MGPipeBuildSubDataRecord / MGPipeForEachSubDataRecordRange), which is also what
// lets a test drive the splitter at both of its bounds without a 4 GiB buffer.

        //   keeps its Resources / VertexElementsCsos (PipeApply.h says so beside them); the
        //   ONLY things that drop a record are the object's own death signal -
        //   resource_destroy, which ~BufferObject raises through

        //   context's records).

        // its Serial for nothing. What the client owes instead is the destroy - which
