"""Paired A/B on a disaggregated-campaign device: one reboot-clean thermal window, interleaved arms.

Its first use was `CONTRACT-P6.md` section 9 item 7 (the paired device gate) and item 8-1 (the
doorbell ledger), and it is not specific to those: the thing it computes is "N transports, one
thermal window, identical protocol" for any transport/backend/case triple the runner accepts.
Everything it does is a step of the protocol in docs/Disaggregated/MEASUREMENTS.md sections 4.4 / 9
/ 11 plus notes/p5f/device-report.md.

Why it is a script and not a shell transcript: a run that wants to be quotable needs the CPU
samples, the pin evidence and the library's own wait ledger to come from the SAME window, and the
three of those are collected by three different mechanisms. Collected by hand they drift apart by
minutes, and the quantity being compared (a few tenths of a millisecond per frame between two
transports) is smaller than that drift.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.

- It does not decide anything about correctness. Benchmark mode takes no snapshot and compares no
  golden (--benchmark replays the whole trace for timing), so an SSIM column here would be a
  fabrication. Correctness on this device is section 3 of the P6 closing snapshot
  (docs/Disaggregated/notes/p6/README.md) and the retrace lanes.
- It does not read `MOBILEGL_TRANSPORT` out of `--transport` on the runner. That flag is applied by
  run_android_retrace_local.py's run_case() path only; run_benchmark_case() passes `args.env`
  alone, so `--transport spawn` alongside `--benchmark` is silently ignored and the arm runs
  monolith while its label says spawn. Measured on this tree (a `--benchmark` run with
  `--transport inproc` wrote no `Config: IPC` line at all, i.e. it was monolith). Every arm here
  therefore spells its transport as an explicit `--env` entry, and every arm is verified against
  the library's own log afterwards. `assert_arm` is the gate on that; an arm that does not prove
  itself is not measured, it is retried and then reported as a failure.

             trace-replay-ci.sh force-stops the package and `am start`s it again - so the main thread
             has a new tid. This is the structural boundary and needs no threshold.
          2. A GAP WIDER THAN THREE POLL INTERVALS. Pids are recycled, and on a device that is
             force-stopping and restarting one app, two consecutive replays really can receive the
             same pid; the dead interval between them is then the only evidence that they were two

        This matters because the divisor and the CPU counters have to describe the SAME stretch of
        work. Summing CPU across three replays and dividing by ONE replay's frame count reports three
