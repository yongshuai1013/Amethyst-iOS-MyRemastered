// Scenario - THE MOBILEGL_PIPE_VERIFY COMPARATOR IS ARMED, AND SAYS SO, AND CAN GO RED.
//
// The third CI mode (ARCHITECTURE.md 13.2-(2)) runs the whole integration suite with two state
// models in one address space: the PipeInputs block the frontend fills at every verb boundary,
// and a SnapshotFromGLContext() taken from the live GLContext. A green run of that mode is only
// worth something if the comparator was actually RUNNING - and "MOBILEGL_PIPE_VERIFY=1 against a
// library that was not built with -DMOBILEGL_PIPE_VERIFY=ON" is a no-op that looks exactly like a
// clean pass. That is the failure mode this scenario exists to make impossible:
//
//   Armed                    - the environment says the comparator is on for this process, so the
//                              library must SAY it armed. It asserts a library observable against
//                              the environment, the same shape UnlocatedIoBlockScenario's arming
//                              case and AsyncCompileScenario::ExtensionStringMatchesTheConfiguration
//                              use. A lane whose library never armed FAILS here; it never passes.
//   CorruptedFieldIsReported - the negative control for the comparator itself (gate G4). With
//                              MOBILEGL_PIPE_VERIFY_CORRUPT naming a field, the snapshot arm is
//                              perturbed before the entry compare, so a comparator that works must
//                              report Fatal{PipeVerifyDiffer, "<Field>@<Verb>"}. A comparator that
//                              compares nothing stays quiet and this case goes red.
//   CorruptedFieldIsReportedOnTheServerRead
//                            - the same control aimed at the OTHER comparator (P7 wave 3, V1).
//                              The entry compare runs on the client thread at a verb boundary; the
//                              compare-at-read hook runs on the server's apply thread at every
//                              backend read, and until this case existed nothing could tell a hook
//                              that had stopped comparing from a hook with nothing to say. It
//                              reads the SERVER role's half of the log, because with the knob
//                              armed the client reports the same field and a union search would be
//                              satisfied by the arm that is not under test.
//
// The observable is the library's own log, because MG_Config is not reachable from this module
// (on Android it links the SHIPPING libMobileGL.so, built -fvisibility=hidden) and the arming
// signal is a latched MGLOG_I. The ctest entry sets MOBILEGL_LOG_FILE_PATH; this only reads it.
//
// Note on scope, and why Armed runs in a lane of its own. The log file is opened with
// fopen(path, "w") at the first log write of a process (MG_Util/Debug/Log.cpp, InitFile), so each
// process TRUNCATES it. That is fine for one process and false for many: in the ambient Verify.
// lane, 400-odd sibling entries share the one MOBILEGL_LOG_FILE_PATH, and CI runs that lane with
// `ctest -j 4`, so a neighbour's bring-up can truncate the file between this case's draw and its
// read. Every existing scenario in this suite that reads the library log (UnlocatedIoBlockScenario,
// the primgen reroute, the point-size demotion) is registered in a FILTERED lane with a log path of
// its own for exactly that reason, and this case now follows them: it runs in the VerifyArming.
// entries, which set MGITEST_PIPE_ARMING_LANE=1 and their own log, and skips everywhere else.
//
// What that proves, stated honestly: the arming line is a property of (this library, this
// environment), not of an individual test body, and the VerifyArming. entry runs the same library
// with the same MOBILEGL_PIPE_VERIFY=1 as its ~400 ambient siblings. One process per backend is
// therefore the whole of the evidence available for "the lane armed" - the per-process claim the
// shared log CANNOT support, because it only ever holds the last writer.
//
// Within the process: the arming line is latched at the FIRST fill, which may be the harness
// bring-up rather than this test's draw, so the arming search is whole-file on purpose; the
// divergence search is restricted to the bytes this case appended, which is where a differ belongs.
