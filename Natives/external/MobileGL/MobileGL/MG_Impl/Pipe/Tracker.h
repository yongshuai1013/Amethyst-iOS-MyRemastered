// The frontend state tracker (ARCHITECTURE.md 5.2, P2 brief D4).
//
// WHERE IT RUNS. Not above MGP_FILL and not in the GL setter: MGPipeValidateForVerb, the
// one statement MGP_FILL already expands to before every gBackendFunctionsTable.GL call
// (PipeFill.h). Blaze3D brackets every batch with glEnable/glDisable(GL_BLEND), so a
// setter that pushed would push twice per batch for a state the batch may not even read;
// the validate point coalesces the whole bracket into the two draws that observe it
// (ARCHITECTURE.md 5.1).
//
// WHAT IT DOES. One Uint32 dirty mask per verb, one bit per row of ARCHITECTURE.md 5.2,
// computed by comparing a shutter against what the tracker last pushed. P2 emitted for bits
// 0..4 (the value-class ones); P3a adds bits 5, 9 and 10 - the vertex-input family - and P4a
// adds SEVEN: 6, 7 and 8 (the program family), 11 (the framebuffer) and 12, 13 and 14 (the
// three unit sets). Only bits 15, 16 and 17 - the const-buffer, shader-buffer and
// stream-output sets - are still computed, latched and counted without an emitter, so the
// per-bit fire rate is a measurement rather than a plan and their fields go through the
// residual fill until P4b.
//
// P4a NARROWS NOTHING AND WIDENS THREE THINGS, and every one of them was an UNDER-FIRE that
// only became reachable once the bit gained an emitter:
//   (1) bit 11's shutter gains the READ framebuffer binding slot's version, because
//       set_framebuffer_state is emitted per bound TARGET and a glBindFramebuffer(
//       GL_READ_FRAMEBUFFER, ...) moved no shutter at all before;
//   (2) bit 13's gains the TEXTURE BIND generation, because glBindSampler moves that one and
//       not the sampling-resolution one, so bind_sampler_states could not see a sampler bind;
//   (3) bits 6/7/8 - and with them bit 14's program half - read the EFFECTIVE program source
//       instead of GetCurrentProgram() alone, which is null for the whole life of a bound
//       separable program pipeline, so a re-composited pipeline reached no program emitter.
// Over-firing is free; all three of those were the other direction.
//
// WHY EVERY SHUTTER OVER-FIRES. A bit that fires too often costs one extra push. A bit
// that fires too rarely renders stale, and ARCHITECTURE.md 13.2 names that as the
// dangerous direction precisely because the P1 verify comparator cannot see it for
// object-class state (it compares those by identity only). So each shutter below is
// deliberately coarser than the state it guards - five bits share one buffer aggregate,
// the framebuffer bit fires on any attachment write anywhere - and the narrowing is P3's
// work, paid for with the fire rates this file publishes.
//
// NO TIMER LIVES HERE. ROADMAP.md forbids committing hot-path instrumentation; the
// absolute ns/draw comes from DriverBench, which times whole frames from outside the
// library (P2 brief D17). The only counting is the per-bit fire tally, behind
// PipeStats::Enabled() like every other counting site in the tree.
//
// HEADER-ONLY, and that is an ownership decision rather than a design one: the P2 brief
// asks for Tracker.{h,cpp}, but the root CMakeLists.txt that would have to name a new .cpp
// belongs to package A and is frozen behind the p2/contract tag. Everything here is
// included by exactly one translation unit in the library (MG_Impl/Pipe/PipeFill.cpp) plus
// the unit tests, so inline costs nothing. Splitting it back out is one list(APPEND) line.

            // back a different composite, which is exactly when a new ShaderCso handle has to
            // be minted. Those are the same non-artefact fields the plain-program arm above
            // reads, and the ones Core.cpp calls out as not passing through ProgramObject's
