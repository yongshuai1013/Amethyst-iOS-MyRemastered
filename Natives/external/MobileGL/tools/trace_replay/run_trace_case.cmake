# MOBILEGL_TRANSPORT reaches the library through the environment, so a `cmake -P` script can set
# it and the child inherits it - exactly how the MOBILEGL_PIPE_VERIFY block at the bottom of this
# file already works, and with no C++ change anywhere. The desktop CLI has no --env option
# (trace_replay_cli.cpp:116-179 is the whole option list) and the Android path already has one
# (trace-replay-ci.sh --env -> trace_replay_core.cpp's setenv block), so an environment read
# covers both directions and a new flag would buy nothing.
#
# TWO WAYS IN, ONE ASSERTION. `-DTRACE_TRANSPORT=` is what the SPLIT ctest variant passes, so
# that entry is self-describing and needs no ritual around it; exporting MOBILEGL_TRANSPORT in
# the calling process is what ~/w7/retrace_gate.py and CI's retrace-split job do over the
# UNCHANGED case names, because the gate parses a FOREIGN reference CTestTestfile.cmake whose
# name regex cannot see a variant suffix. Setting the variable from the -D FIRST means the

# --- P5: MOBILEGL_TRANSPORT, the split arm's own assertions ----------------------------------
#
# The same problem the verify block above solves, with the same answer and one extra reason to
# need it. A retrace that exported MOBILEGL_TRANSPORT=inproc at a library configured WITHOUT
# -DMOBILEGL_BUILD_DISAGGREGATED=ON is not merely a no-op: the variable's PARSER does not exist
# in that build at all (CONTRACT-P5 5 - putting a complaint in the unconditional part of
# ConfigLoader would move a pull-build symbol and break gate G1), so the value is accepted by the
# environment and silently ignored, every frame still matches its golden, and the case reports a
# clean pass having run monolith end to end.
#
# THE LIBRARY'S OWN LOG IS THE ONLY CHANNEL a `cmake -P` script has for the difference, and it is
# also THE ONLY VALID REFUSAL CENSUS. A `ctest -V` transcript is a FALSE ZERO for Fatal{...}
# lines: the console sink is compiled out of the configurations these lanes run, so the aborts
# reach output/mobilegl.log and nowhere else. That is why TRACE_OUTPUT_DIR and TRACE_ARTIFACT_DIR
# carry the variant - without it both arms write one output/mobilegl.log, the second run wipes
# the first, and the census silently becomes a census of one arm. P4a shipped that defect once
# already; this is the same defect in a new place, pre-empted.
#
# Three demands, all silent when MOBILEGL_TRANSPORT is unset or "monolith":
#   * mobilegl.log exists - the replay wrote one, so the library was loaded and logging;
#   * it carries ConfigLoader's inproc line, which is emitted ONLY by a build that compiled the
#     parser AND resolved the value to InProcess. This is the falsifiable half;
#   * it carries no Fatal{ at all. Under split the emit table raises
#     Fatal{UnmigratedVerb, "<slot>"} for the 64 slots P5 does not implement, so a clean run of a
#     reduced-path target is a run that touched none of them - and any other Fatal{ (ProtocolCorruption,
#     UnmigratedPipeInput, AbiMismatch) is a real defect. The count and the distinct names are
#     printed either way, because the census is the deliverable even when the run passes.
