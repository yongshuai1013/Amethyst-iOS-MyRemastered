// P7 gate 5 (g5-msrbo, g5-msprobe): WHICH ARM RESOLVES A MULTISAMPLE DEPTH/STENCIL ASPECT FIRST.
//
// The wire arm has two (WireFramebuffer.inc, ResolveWireDepthStencil): a render pass that carries
// a VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve attachment and no draw, and the baked shader pass of
// WireMultisampleResolve.inc, which draws. P7 wave 2-B2 took the render pass wherever the
// extension exists. On the Redmi (Adreno 830, Vulkan 1.3.284, driver 512.800.71) that pass left
// its resolve target unwritten - KHR-GL46.direct_state_access.renderbuffers_storage_multisample
// read every resolved depth and stencil value back as 0 on the inproc arm while the monolith arm
// passed, and the same case passed on the device with the shader arm forced
// (MGITEST_MAGMA_FORCE_SHADER_DEPTH_RESOLVE=1).
//
// A DRIVER THAT CLAIMS WHAT IT CANNOT DO IS A POST PROBE, NOT A VENDOR QUIRK (standing rule,
// 2026-08-22). The first fix keyed the order on Qualcomm's vendor id; it is replaced by a probe
// that reproduces the production resolve on the actual VkDevice (WireDepthResolveProbe.cpp) and
// asks the one question the order depends on: does the no-draw render pass write the resolve
// target? A driver that fixes the defect gets the fast arm back, and a driver of any vendor that
// has it gets the shader arm - neither needs a table edit.
//
// EVERY BUG PROBE CARRIES A CONTROL (MG_Util/SelfTest/DriverBugProbes.h). The control is the
// production SHADER arm fed the same inputs: when it does not resolve them either, the probe has
// measured its own setup (or a device that cannot resolve depth at all) rather than the render
// pass, the verdict is INCONCLUSIVE, and the default order stands.
//
// This header is the pure half - the measurement, the verdict, the test knob and the choice - so
// a unit test pins every mapping with a fake result source (MG_Test/Pipeline/PipelineQuirkTest.cpp).
// The Vulkan half that fills the measurement is WireDepthResolveProbe.{h,cpp}.
