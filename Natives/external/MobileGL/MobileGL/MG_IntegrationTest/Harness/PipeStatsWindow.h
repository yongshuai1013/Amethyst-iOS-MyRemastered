// Reading ONE PipeStats summary window out of the library's own log, for the scenarios whose
// claim is about a counter rather than about pixels.
//
// WHY THROUGH A LOG FILE AT ALL. MG_Util::PipeStats is internal to the library and this module
// cannot link against it (ScenarioFixture.h has the long version: on Android this binary links
// the SHIPPING libMobileGL.so, built -fvisibility=hidden). The library's `MGPipe stats:` line is
// the only channel, so a lane that wants to read a counter sets MOBILEGL_PIPE_STATS=1,
// MOBILEGL_PIPE_STATS_PERIOD=1 - one line per eglSwapBuffers - and a MOBILEGL_LOG_FILE_PATH of
// its OWN.
//
// THE LOG PATH HAS TO BE PRIVATE TO ONE CTEST ENTRY, and that is not a style rule: the library
// opens it fopen(path, "w"), so every process launched in a lane TRUNCATES it. Two entries of one
// lane reading the same path race under `ctest -j`, and the shape of the failure is an empty read
// that looks exactly like "the counter was never emitted". So a case that reads a window gets a
// ctest entry whose TEST_FILTER selects that case alone, with a log path nothing else writes -
// the rule PipeVerifyArmingScenario and CsoContentAddressingScenario already follow.
//
// THE WINDOW IS "SINCE THE PREVIOUS LINE" (PipeStats::FormatWindowLine), so the caller closes the
// setup window with a swap, runs the workload, swaps again, and reads the LAST line - which then
// covers the workload and nothing else.

    // P6: MOBILEGL_LOG_FILE_PATH IS A BASE NAME, NOT A FILE. The library writes one log per
    // ROLE - `<stem>.client<ext>` and `<stem>.server<ext>` - because under inproc both roles are
    // threads of one process and a single file made every per-side assertion a search.
    //
    // THE RULE IS COPIED HERE AND IT HAS TO BE, which is worth stating because the obvious fix is
    // to call the library's own MG_Util::Debug::RoleLogPath and delete this. That does not link:
    // this module links the SHIPPING libMobileGL.so, built -fvisibility=hidden, and the role-path
    // helpers are `t` (local) in it - only MG_Test, which links the static archive, may call them.

    // MOBILEGL_LOG_FILE_PATH unchanged. In the verify lane it therefore opened a file that never
