// THE 41 NULL CHECKS. Owner: package c1 (CONTRACT-P5.md §7, ID-14).
//
// FORTY-ONE OF THE SIXTY-NINE GLFunctionsTable SLOTS ARE NULL-CHECKED AT THEIR CALL SITE, AND
// SEVERAL OF THOSE CHECKS ARE CAPABILITY PROBES RATHER THAN SAFETY CHECKS. R-4 forbids a null
// slot in the client's emit table - so in that table every one of those probes would answer
// "supported", and whatever fallback sits behind it would silently disappear. That is not a
// theoretical risk: it is how a split lane produces a plausible picture for the wrong reason.
// ARCHITECTURE.md:114 already said what replaces the probe - "CallMask replaces 'is this table
// slot null' as the implicit capability probe" - and this header is the concrete list.
//
// TWO SPELLINGS, AND WHICH ONE A SITE TAKES IS DECIDED BY THE SLOT'S CLASS, NOT BY TASTE:
//
//   MGL_BACKEND_SLOT_CAP(Slot, CapBit)
//       The capability has a published bit. Under split the answer is the SERVER's bit;
//       under monolith it is exactly today's null check, character for character.
//       The three cases CONTRACT-P5.md §7 names by hand are all of this shape:
//         GL_Query.cpp:481 / :558 / :785  BeginOcclusionQuery   -> kCapOcclusionQuery
//         GL_Query.cpp:534                BeginXfbPrimitivesQuery -> kCapXfbPrimitivesQuery
//         PipeFill.cpp                    SubDataResident        -> kCapResidentSubData
//       (the third is not a GLFunctionsTable slot but an op-table one, so it reads the bit
//        directly in PipeFill.cpp rather than through this header).
//
//   MGL_BACKEND_SLOT_LOCAL(Slot)
//       The capability has NO published bit and the slot is CONTRACT-P5.md §7 class C -
//       Fatal{UnmigratedVerb} in the client's table. Under split the honest answer is
//       "absent", which is precisely what the monolith nullptr meant, so every fallback the
//       site already has survives instead of being replaced by an abort. Under monolith it is
//       again today's null check.
//
// WHY "ABSENT" AND NOT "LET IT FATAL". A Fatal is loud, and for the 28 UNGUARDED slots it is
// strictly better than today (a null there is already an immediate crash with no diagnostic).
// But a guarded site is guarded because the frontend has a real answer for the absent case -
// always-signaled syncs, a CPU readback, CPU primitive accounting - and turning that answer
// into an abort is a behaviour change nobody asked for, in the direction that stops a lane
// dead. The class-C slot IS absent from this client; saying so is the accurate answer, not a
// weakening of R-4.
//
// THE TEST THAT DECIDES WHETHER A GUARDED SITE IS CONVERTED AT ALL, and it is the half of the
// walk the contract leaves to whoever does it: A PROBE MOVES ONLY WHERE "ABSENT" IS A CORRECT
// AND SUFFICIENT ANSWER. Where the fallback behind the probe produces a RIGHT result, "absent"
// is the accurate description of a client that does not have the slot, and converting keeps
// the lane running. Where the fallback produces a SILENTLY WRONG result, converting would
// manufacture exactly the defect R-4 exists to prevent, and the probe is left alone so the
// class-C slot Fatals by name instead.
//
// Converted, because the fallback is right:
//   FenceSync used this fallback through P5. P5b §9 moved it to class B: the frontend
//   now calls the emitter and the server preserves the optional/native-null fallback.
//   GetTexImage/GetTextureImage now emit owned texture readback replies. Their
//   split path must never use the frontend shadow after GPU writes.
//   GL_Getter.cpp x2 GetGpuTimestampNs and GL_Query.cpp's query probes now use their
//   timer/occlusion/primitive capability bits. An advertised path emits real query
//   records; only an unavailable native capability reports COUNTER_BITS 0.
//
// NOT converted, deliberately, because "absent" would be wrong rather than quiet:
//   GL_Drawing.cpp:1274/:1371/:1420/:1435/:1641/:1673  the transform-feedback span family. The
//       frontend reads a null EndTransformFeedback as "this backend does NOT own the capture,
//       so reorder the captured records for it" (FixupGsStripCaptureOrder, :1290). Under split
//       the server's backend DOES own it, so answering "absent" would reorder a capture that
//       was already in GL order - a silently corrupt buffer. Transform feedback is off P5's
//       reduced path (BRIEF §4's exclusion list) and its slots are class C, so the first XFB
//       call aborts by name, which is the outcome R-4 asks for.
//   GL_Drawing.cpp:844  PatchParameteri. "Absent" means the patch size is never set and every
//       tessellation draw silently uses the previous one. Class C; it aborts by name.
//
// P5b t2 CLOSED THE FIRST OF THOSE TWO, AND THE OTHER SIX SITES NEEDED NOTHING (CONTRACT-P5B.md
// §2 t2, §6.5). The six SPAN sites - :1274 Begin, :1371 End, :1420 Pause, :1435 Resume, :1641
// Delete, :1673 Bind - are guards over a slot that is now class B in the client's table, so they
// simply call the emitter; their `if (const auto f = ...)` shape is left exactly as it was,
// because under split the slot is non-null and under monolith nothing moved. THE PROBE AT :1290
// IS THE ONE THAT HAD TO CHANGE, and it is the reason this header said the XFB span family would
// be the first to need a bit: it is not a guard on a call, it is a QUESTION ABOUT THE BACKEND
// asked of a table that under split belongs to the client. It now reads
// MGL_BACKEND_SLOT_CAP(EndTransformFeedback, kCapBackendOwnsXfbCapture), the bit the server sets
// from ITS table in MG_Backend/Init.cpp's InitSplitRoles. Espryt registers the slot and answers
// yes; Magma registers no XFB slot, answers no, and the client keeps reordering for it exactly
// as it does under monolith. GL_Drawing.cpp:844's PatchParameteri stays a plain guard for the
// same reason as the six: the slot is class B now, so "absent" never arises.
//
// DeleteTransformFeedback now emits DeleteStreamOutput with the object's lifetime
// identity; its ordinary slot guard reaches that emitter under a transport.
//
// WHAT THIS HEADER DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not touch the 28 unguarded slots: those
// have no probe to convert, and calling one reaches Fatal{UnmigratedVerb, "<slot>"} by name,
// which is R-4's intent. And it does not invent a cap bit - a new MGPCapBit is an
// MGPipeTypes.h edit and that file is c0's, so a family that needs one goes through the
// integrator (the XFB span family is the first that will). It did: P5b's contract granted t2
// exactly that one bit, kCapBackendOwnsXfbCapture (CONTRACT-P5B.md §6.5, §8), and t2 added it.
//
// G1: in a build without MOBILEGL_BUILD_DISAGGREGATED both macros expand to the null check the
// site already had, so the pull build's code generation is unchanged.
