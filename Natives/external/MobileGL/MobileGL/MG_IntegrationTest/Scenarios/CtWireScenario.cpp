// P5c ct (MG_Remote/CONTRACT-P5C.md §5): the two control records, end to end over inproc.
//
// applier_reset (§5.1): this process's first validate primes the pipe tracker, and the
// FreshlyPrimed edge is the record's producer (MG_Impl/Pipe/PipeFill.cpp). What the scenario
// asserts is the SERVER sink's own counters - moved by nobody else - plus the pixels, so a
// reset that never crossed is red by the tally and a client that fell through to the driver
// is red by ScenarioFixture's emit-ordinal rule.
//
// object_death (§5.2): a texture and a framebuffer die, the deaths cross, and the slots
// recycle. The picture after recycling is the behavioural half: a stale twin answering for
// the recycled object renders the DEAD object's content (or errors), which is the exact
// shape LiveGenAt's generation check exists to refuse.
//
// RED ONCE for the reset (executed, recorded in the package report): reverting PipeFill's
// FreshlyPrimed arm to the GL-thread direct MGPipeApplierReset() call aborts this whole lane
// with Fatal{RoleViolation, "g_applier"} out of the applier's layer-2 guard. The automated
// half of that control is TheDirectApplierResetCallOnTheGLThreadIsRoleViolation below, and
// the guard's two non-Fatal arms are pinned in PipeWireCodecTest's CtWireFatals suite.

    // will APPLY a write implements the resident arm: the client has no op table of its own
    // to probe (MGPipeResourceOpsHaveSubDataResident says so in as many words) and reads this
    // bit instead. Until this package nothing ever ORed it into the server's mask, so the
    // answer was permanently "no" - which silently pinned BOTH backends to the ordered
    // in-place host memcpy and made Magma's own SubDataResident arm
    // (VkBufferManager.cpp's g_vulkanWireResourceOps) dead code on the wire. A capability
    // that is never published is indistinguishable from one that does not exist, and no
    // pixel, GL query or error can tell the two apart - so the bit itself is the assertion.

    // MagmaTransportPublishesRealBufferConsumersWithoutRunAhead pins that the bit is DERIVED

    // a backend enum, which is ID-39's lesson. This case pins the other half - that what the
    // server published actually reached the client - and the two together are what make the
    // frontend's read of it mean anything.

    // WHAT IT DOES NOT PIN, AND THE REASON IS R-6 RATHER THAN AN OMISSION. This does not
    // assert that a `buffer_subdata_resident` record (opcode 49) crossed, because under a
    // transport none can yet: the resident arm is reached only from a store that is GPU
    // RESIDENT, residency comes only from AdoptPersistentMap, and every persistent-map
