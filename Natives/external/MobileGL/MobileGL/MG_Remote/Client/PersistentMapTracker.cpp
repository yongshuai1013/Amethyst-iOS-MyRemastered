    // THE MPROTECT DIRTY TRACKER. Scanning a persistent write map for changes is
    // O(range) per verb no matter how cheap the hash is (measured: a ~10 MB arena
    // hashed at every draw is the whole frame at view distance 12). The MMU
    // already knows what changed: after each push the range is protected
    // PROT_READ, the application's next write faults, the handler marks the page
    // dirty and makes it writable again, and the next push ships only the 64 KB
    // blocks that contain a faulted page. The per-frame cost collapses from
    // "hash every block of every arena at every draw" to "one fault per touched
    // page per push-cycle plus the block pushes that always existed".
    //
    // THE TABLE IS A FIXED ARRAY, NOT A MAP: the SIGSEGV handler runs on ANY
    // thread (chunk builders write arenas off the render thread) while
    // registration runs on the GL thread, so the handler scans a lock-free array
    // of atomics; the GL thread publishes an entry by writing pageBits, then end,
    // then base with release ordering, and retires one by clearing base first.
    //
    // CHAINING IS LOAD-BEARING: the JVM uses SIGSEGV for implicit null checks,
    // so a fault outside every tracked range MUST reach the previous handler or
    // the first NPE after this installs is a process kill. Ownership is three
    // tests, applied in the handler below: kernel-raised permission fault
    // (SEGV_ACCERR - never a userspace raise, never an unmapped page), inside a
    // live tracked range, and not an immediate same-instruction refault (a write
    // we unprotected succeeds, so an instant refault is a non-write access and
    // must crash honestly). Everything failing any test is chained verbatim.

        //     tracker never raises SIGSEGV itself, so a user-raised one is always foreign.
        // (2) INSIDE A LIVE TRACKED RANGE: a fault anywhere else is the application's.
        // (3) NOT A REFAULT WITHOUT RE-ARM: a write to a page this handler just
        //     unprotected SUCCEEDS, so a fault on a page whose dirty bit is still set
        //     is either a sibling thread mid-answer (answered once more, idempotently)

        //     the discriminator - see RefaultOfANonWriteAccess.

        // THE TWO ADDRESS SPACES THIS MODULE STRADDLES, AND THE ONE ROW WHERE THEY MEET.
        // Bionic tags every heap pointer on a TBI-capable arm64 - POINTER_TAG 0xb4 in the
        // top byte, turned on process-wide by PR_TAGGED_ADDR_ENABLE for every app built
        // against a recent target SDK - so the shadow pointer MappedData() hands back, and
        // with it every base/end this table publishes, carries that tag. THE KERNEL DOES
        // NOT: a fault's si_addr is the untagged faulting virtual address. The tombstone of
        // the crash that found this prints both forms of the one address on adjacent lines -
        // "x0 b4000073ac9a5000" (the pointer the application was writing through) against
        // "fault addr 0x00000073ac9a5000" (what the kernel put in si_addr).
        //
        // Comparing one space against the other makes `address < base` true for EVERY fault,
        // so ownership test (2) never matched, every fault on a page this module had itself
        // protected was chained to debuggerd, and the process died on the application's FIRST
        // legitimate write through a persistent write map. It is invisible on x86-64, which
        // has no top-byte tag, which is why every host lane stayed green while all three

        // normalised base is exactly what protecting through the tagged one did - mprotect
        // untags its own address argument (do_mprotect_pkey's untagged_addr) - and every
        // other use of base/end here is either an mprotect or a difference against a shadow
        // base normalised the same way, so nothing else has to change. Pointer DEREFERENCES
        // keep the tagged pointer they came from (PushBlocksFor's two edge hashes), because
