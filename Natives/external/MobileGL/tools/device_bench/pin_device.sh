#
# Frequency pinning for the two disaggregation-campaign devices, standalone: pure adb + su, no
# sourcing of a device profile, no dependency on bench.sh. It exists because bench.sh's
# pin_freqs()/unpin_freqs() are MediaTek-legacy-only (/proc/ppm + /proc/gpufreq) and NEITHER of
# these two devices has those paths - on both of them bench.sh's pin writes into nothing and
# exits 0, which is precisely the silent "the run looks pinned but is not" failure the
# PROFILE_VERIFIED guard was built to catch. So: pin here, run bench.sh with --no-pin, and use
# `check` in place of the pin-integrity fields bench.sh would otherwise have sampled.
#
#   ./pin_device.sh 35d0befa pin
#   ./bench.sh --device devices/xiaomi-adreno830.env --backend magma --no-pin
#   ./pin_device.sh 35d0befa check   || echo "PIN DRIFTED - discard this run"
#   ./pin_device.sh 35d0befa unpin
#
# All three actions print the live big/little/GPU frequencies, the governors and the gate
# temperature, so the output of `pin` and of `unpin` is itself the before/after evidence.
#
# check exit codes (deliberately three-valued: "no pin at all" and "a pin that slipped" are
# different facts, and collapsing them to one non-zero would hide which one happened):
#   0  PINNED  - every pinned node is at its pin AND every live frequency equals it
#   1  DRIFT   - the device is partly pinned, or a live frequency has left its pin. The
#                dangerous state: a run overlapping this is not comparable. Discard it.
#   2  UNPINNED- no node is at a pin this script set; the vendor governors have their range
#                back. That is the correct state to leave a device in, and it is still non-zero
#                so that `pin_device.sh X check && measure` cannot silently measure unpinned.
#                Note this is asserted against OUR pins, not against the stock range: ColorOS
#                moves policy4's max on its own within seconds of a release, so an exact-stock
#                comparison reported DRIFT on a correctly unpinned device.
#
# Values were read off each device on 2026-09-07 and confirmed against a pinned window; see
# ../REPORT.md and the matching *.env profiles. Stock values are hardcoded rather than sampled
# at pin time on purpose - a restore that reads "stock" from an already-pinned device would
# make the pin permanent, which is how a device silently stays clamped across a reboot-less
# week of runs.
