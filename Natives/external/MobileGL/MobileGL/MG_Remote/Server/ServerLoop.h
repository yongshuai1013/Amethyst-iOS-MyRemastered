// The apply thread and the server's private backend object. Owner: package v1 - the highest
// risk item in P5. Signatures by c0.
//
// WHY THE THREAD IS THE POINT. DirectGLES has 16 IsBackendContextCurrentOnThisThread() guards
// (DirectGLES.cpp:12034..12428) and Managers.cpp has 16 CanTouchGLNow() guards (:1494..:3428);
// every one of them DEGRADES when the answer is false - fences become always-signaled, queries
// return null handles, Present creates no frame fence so the buffer pool's recycle watermark
// never advances, and the two persistent-map acquisitions (Managers.cpp:1494, :2170) DECLINE,
// which would make PersistentCoherentMapScenario unreachable. Making the apply thread the
// context owner for life turns all 32 of those answers true on the server and removes the
// whole degradation class at once. It is also exactly the shape P6's spawned server inherits.
//
// P5 BUILDS ONE THREAD, NOT TWO. No mgl-srv-io: inproc's control plane is in the same process.
// P6 splits it.
//
// PARKING AND SHUTDOWN. The thread parks on Doorbell::Wait(consumerParked, ready, spinUs,
// kWaitForever) and shuts down when Wait returns false with Dead() set. TWO things can un-park a
// kWaitForever waiter, not one, and the difference is the whole of review m-4: for the STOP case a
// plain Doorbell::Notify() is sufficient, because m_stopRequested is in the park predicate and
// Stop() publishes it BEFORE it rings (Doorbell.h re-tests ready() after every Park return);
// Doorbell::Kill() (Doorbell.h, CondVarDoorbell::Kill) is load-bearing only for a predicate
// that has NOTHING to see, which is why the redcheck's park-predicate-loses-control entry - the one that drops the
// control flag FROM the predicate - is the case that actually times out. Kill BEFORE join; join
// before the client frees any emitter-owned Vector; and the join must be bounded (that test uses
// 5 s) so a regression is a red test and not a hung CI job.
//
// THE EGL OWNERSHIP MOVE, AS MEASURED (ID-54; review v2 item 10 and N-3). The native
// eglMakeCurrent for a surface runs ONCE PER CONTEXT LIFETIME on this thread and the context is
// then held for life. That "once" lives in TWO layers, because one is not enough:
// DirectGLES::MakeCurrent always calls native eglMakeCurrent and rewrites the owner (codex C7),
// and it is reached twice per bring-up - once from InitPbufferSurface/InitWindowSurface when the
// surface is CREATED, and once more from the client's first eglMakeCurrent. So (1)
// ServerMakeEGLCurrent classifies the request against the tuple it last bound
// (ClassifyEglMakeCurrent): an identical repeat is a no-op, and the R-12 republish decision for
// it is "nothing to republish" (ID-67: the client's mirror generation must not move); a different
// tuple is a real forwarded bind AND a caps republish; a client release-current is RECORDED
// (ClientReleaseCount) and NOT forwarded. And (2) BackendObject_DirectGLES::MakeEGLCurrent, under
// an active transport only, skips the native call when the requested draw surface is the one
// already natively current on this thread (IsBackendContextCurrentOnThisThread, which is EGL
// ground truth) AND the virtual tuple is the one that bind was for - or the bind is the surface's
// own creation, which the first tuple adopts; a different virtual context onto the same surface
// binds natively again, because MakeCurrent's invalidations describe the frontend context that
// changed (ID-67). Measured at the EGL function
// table by ServerLoopTest's C7 control on a real llvmpipe context: surface creation + two
// identical make-currents + a client release + a bind after the release = ONE native
// eglMakeCurrent, ZERO native releases, and the apply thread still the owner afterwards. So
// DirectGLES.cpp's six cache invalidations run once per context lifetime rather than once per
// client make-current, and the 16 IsBackendContextCurrentOnThisThread() / 16 CanTouchGLNow()
// sites answer TRUE on the server. The tuple is FORGOTTEN (N-3) on every event after which the
// native context it names may be gone - ReleaseEGLResources, ReleaseEGLSurface of the surface it
// names, a surface (re)creation, backend destruction - so a recycled handle value after a destroy
// is a real bind again and never a silent no-context-current. The client's nine EGL virtuals
// become BLOCKING control requests executed here. ReleaseEGLResources and
// ~BackendObject_DirectGLES MUST be blocking: MobileGL::Destroy() (MobileGL/Init.cpp:68)
// otherwise walks on while the server still holds the context.
//
// THE FALLBACK IS PRE-DECLARED, NOT INVENTED UNDER PRESSURE (R-1). If the context migration is
// still not running ClearThenReadPixels at the end of v1's fourth working day, the integrator -
// not the package - declares `inproc-inline`: the client thread drains the ring itself, no
// thread is created, no context migrates, and a second package picks up the thread arm.

    //
    // The old body paid five times over for that "no": ServerLoopInstance()'s function-static
    // guard byte, an acquire load of m_running, an acquire load of an atomic<std::thread::id>,
    // std::this_thread::get_id(), and a thread::id comparison that is an out-of-line
    // pthread_equal through the PLT (@plt was 6.1% of the apply thread). None of it carries
    // information the guard needs. A live thread's identity is already sitting in a
    // register-cheap place - the thread pointer, TPIDR_EL0 on aarch64 - so the loop publishes
    // ITS identity as a plain integer here and every caller compares one relaxed load against
    // one register read, inline, with no call and no singleton.
    //
    // ZERO MEANS "NO APPLY THREAD IS RUNNING", which is exactly the answer m_running == false
    // used to give: the key is published as the apply thread's FIRST act (ApplyThreadMain) and
    // cleared in the same m_controlMutex critical section that clears m_running on the way out
    // (ApplyThreadMain's C2 exit block), so "key != 0" and "m_running" move together and the
    // window in which a live-but-exiting apply thread answers true is byte-for-byte the old
    // one. The ServerLoop object still OWNS the key - nothing but ApplyThreadMain writes it -
    // it simply no longer has to be reached through the singleton to be read.

        // overwrote. A stale ZERO is harmless in the other direction: a thread that is not the
