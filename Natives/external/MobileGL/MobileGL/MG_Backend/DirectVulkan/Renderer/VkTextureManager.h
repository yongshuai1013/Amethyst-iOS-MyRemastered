// (RGBA2, RGBA12) and several three-channel ones are deliberately widened to their four-channel twin
// because Vulkan devices rarely support the 3-channel layouts.
//
// SHARED, and it must stay the only answer to that question. A renderbuffer and a texture of the
// same GL format have to resolve to the SAME VkFormat or every blit, resolve and glCopyImageSubData
// between them crosses a size-incompatible pair, which vkCmdCopyImage leaves undefined
// (VUID-vkCmdCopyImage-srcImage-01548). The renderbuffer path used to carry a hand-maintained second
// copy of this table that was missing four rows - RGBA2, RGBA4, RGB5A1 and RGBA12 - so those four

// as {width, layers, 1} (see GL_Texture.cpp's AllocateStorage and the completeness walk in
// TextureObject.cpp, which shrinks only x down the chain). Vulkan packs it the other way: a
// 1D array is a VK_IMAGE_TYPE_1D image whose extent.height MUST be 1 and whose layers live in
// arrayLayers - i.e. in the slot this backend reads out of z. So every place that turns a GL
// level size into Vulkan image geometry has to move the count across first, and every GL-space
// sub-box that rides along with it has to move its y the same way. DirectGLES performs the
// identical remap onto the ES 2D array it maps 1D arrays to (GetBackendUploadSize).

// THE ONE COPY, deliberately. This used to exist twice - privately in VkRenderPassManager.cpp and

// attachment view and VkFramebufferCreateInfo::layers from one, while the CLEAR key built from the
// other is written verbatim into VkImageSubresourceRange::layerCount when a queued glClear is
// materialised outside a render pass (MaterializePendingClearForTexture). They are two consumers
// of the same GL clear, so any disagreement means the same glClear produces two different pictures
// depending only on which path happens to consume it first - and the materialise path then POPS
// the entry, so the other one never runs. Fixing one copy and leaving the other is exactly how
// that split gets introduced; keep them the same function.
//
// Two shapes make this more than `size.z()`:
//   * GL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY keeps its layer count in the state-side HEIGHT (see ToVulkanLevelExtent
//     just above), so z reads 1 and every layer above the first was silently dropped.
//   * GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP is attached layered as its REPRESENTATIVE upload target, the +X face
//     (ResolveRepresentableFramebufferTextureUploadTarget), and one face's level size has z = 1 -
//     but a layered cube attachment names all six faces (GL 4.6 core 9.2.8), which are the image's
