# EXIT GATE E1's NEGATIVE CONTROL and EXIT GATE E3(a)'s.
#
# This file is the body of .github/workflows/test.yml's "Negative controls (barrier, map push)"
# step, which requires the verb barrier and the persistent-map push to be load-bearing. It lives in
# the repository rather than inline in the workflow for one reason: a workflow `run:` block cannot
# be executed anywhere except on a runner, so the logic below was unreviewable and untestable until
# it ran in CI - and when the wave-1 cross-family review claimed it was broken, confirming the
# claim needed a hand-made copy of these lines with their inputs stubbed (wave1-codex-verify.md 8).
# A copy is not the thing. The smoke test at scripts/ci/control_smoke_test.sh now runs THIS file,
# so the lines CI executes and the lines the smoke test proves are the same lines.
#
# WHAT THE REVIEW FOUND (ID-46 finding 8, CONFIRMED by execution; ID-48 assigns it here).
# The previous version accepted ANY non-zero ctest exit as "the knob is load-bearing". A timeout, a
# setup abort, an unrelated assertion, a harness that died before it read the knob at all - every
# one of them printed "turned N selected entries red, as it must" and the step went green. The
# verifier demonstrated it: a stubbed ctest with a NON-EMPTY selection that failed with
# `UNRELATED_CONTROL_FAILURE` produced both controls' success messages and HARNESS_EXIT=0.
#
# So each control now has to say WHY the red is its own:
#
#   1. THE BASELINE MUST BE GREEN. The arming run below used to end in `|| true` and count every
#      case that was not <skipped/> as "ran" - so a case that RAN AND FAILED armed the controls,
#      and a control that turns an already-red entry red proves nothing at all. It now counts
#      PASSED cases, and a baseline with any failure in it is a hard error rather than an arming
#      signal.
#   2. THE RED MUST CARRY THE SELECTED CASE'S OWN FAILURE TEXT. Each control names a regex of the
#      diagnostics its scenarios emit when that knob is off, and the red is refused if the output
#      carries none of them.
#
# WHY THE EVIDENCE IS THE SCENARIO'S ASSERTION TEXT AND NOT THE KNOB'S OWN LOG LINE.
# ConfigLoader logs a named line for both knobs (ConfigLoader.cpp:385-393, "is the R-1 NEGATIVE
# CONTROL", "is the E3(a) NEGATIVE CONTROL"), and it is tempting to grep for that. It is not
# evidence: it is written at config load, by every process in the run, whatever happens next. A
# setup abort would carry it too. It proves the knob was READ, never that the knob caused the red.
# Only the failing case's own diagnostic does that. E1 now observes deterministic transport
# waits in dedicated CPU tests; E3(a) retains its scenario assertion and private library log.
# P5e ID-122: ordinary run-ahead draws need not fail with VERB_BARRIER=0, and the old
# overlap Fatal cannot fire with the default BATCH_WAITS=1. Pixel failures are not E1 evidence.

# THE FOURTH ARGUMENT IS NEW AND E3(a) IS WHY. The header above argues that the knob's own
# ConfigLoader line is not evidence, and that is still true: it is written at config load, by
# every process in the run, whatever happens next. What IS evidence is a line the knob's
# BEHAVIOUR emits at the site that changed - and until now E3(a) had none, because
# PersistentMapTracker::PushBlocksFor simply `return`ed at blockBytes == 0. The joint gate
# recorded exactly that ("There is no Fatal for block size zero ... No nonexistent private-file
# Fatal is quoted", joint-v1.md 3) and ID-65 assigned the missing line here. With it, E3(a) no
# longer rests on a pixel assertion alone: the red must carry the scenario's own diagnostic AND
# the library's own statement that the push was disabled, from the entry's private file.
# The optional 5th positional is a ctest -E EXCLUSION, applied to every ctest invocation this
# function makes. It exists because ctest -R is POSIX ERE: there is no negative lookahead, so a
# selection that must say "these, except that one" cannot say it in -R alone. E1 below is the
# case that forced it (ID-122).
