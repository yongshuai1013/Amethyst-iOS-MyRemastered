// P3a's resource family: the applier's record lifecycle and the client's emission of it.
//
// THE TARGET AND ITS ctest REGISTRATION ARE THE CONTRACT COMMIT'S; THE CONTENTS ARE NOT.
// Two packages fill this file in and neither of them touches MG_Test/Pipe/CMakeLists.txt to
// do it: the applier-side cases (a create marks the slot live, a respecify replaces the
// descriptor and bumps Serial, a destroy clears Live, a stale generation resolves to nothing,
// HasLiveHostWrites is false on every path this phase has, and the sub-data range ENCODING at
// both of its bounds) belong to the branch that gives the entry points their bodies; the
// emitter-side cases (the sticky BindMask over every buffer target, on create AND on a
// following respecify; the slot released at destruction; and the SPLITTER over that encoding,
// which lives in the client's ResourceTracker) belong to the client branch. They are disjoint
// TEST bodies in one file.
//
// THE SUITE IS `ResourceEmit`, not `ResourceEmitTest`: the file is XTest.cpp and the suite is
// X, which is this directory's convention (RenderStateSpansTest.cpp -> RenderStateSpans), and
// it is what the phase's gate greps for (`ctest -R '...|ResourceEmit\.'`).
//
// IT HAS ITS OWN main(), like PipeInputsTest and RenderStateSpansTest, and that is a decision
// taken here so that nobody has to come back to the CMake file for it: the applier's bounds
// gate reports through a trip wire whose verdict is a log line in a shipped push build and
// std::abort() in a poison or verify one, so a case that drives it reads the line back out of
// a file this process points MOBILEGL_LOG_FILE_PATH at before anything logs.
//
// Every case is a visible SKIP in a pull build rather than a vanishing test - the applier is
// compiled only under MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH - so `ctest -N` stays name-for-name identical
// between the pull and the push trees.

    // THE SPLITTER IS NOT TESTED HERE, deliberately: it lives in the client's ResourceTracker
    // and does not exist yet on this branch. What IS tested here is the thing the splitter is
