> ⚠️ Note: There are no plans to reset the Android version (there are too many excellent Android launchers, such as Zalith Launcher, Fold Craft Launcher, and the unfinished ShardLauncher), if you need the official Android code, please go to [Amethyst-Android](https://github.com/AngelAuraMC/Amethyst-Android).


## 🚀 Quick Start Guide
For complete installation and setup documentation, please refer to [Amethyst Official Wiki](https://wiki.angelauramc.dev/wiki/getting_started/INSTALL.html#ios), or check my [Bilibili tutorial video](https://b23.tv/KyxZr12). The following are simplified steps:


### 📱 Device Requirements
| Type | System Version Requirements | Supported Device List |
|------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Minimum** | iOS 14.0 and above | iPhone 6s+/iPad 5th gen+/iPad Air 2+/iPad mini 4+/All iPad Pro/iPod touch 7th gen |
| **Recommended** | iOS 14.5 and above (better experience) | iPhone XS+ (excluding XR/SE 2nd gen), iPad 10th gen+/Air 4th gen+/mini 6th gen+/iPad Pro (excluding 9.7 inch) |

> ⚠️ Key Reminder: Serious compatibility issues exist with iOS 14.0~14.4.2, **strongly recommended to upgrade to iOS 14.5+**; Supports iOS 17.x/iOS 18.x, but requires computer assistance for configuration, see [Official JIT Guide](https://wiki.angelauramc.dev/wiki/faq/ios/JIT.html#what-are-the-methods-to-enable-jit) for details; Supports iOS 26.x (called iOS 19.x in source code), but no special adaptation has been made, unpredictable issues may occur.


### 🔧 Sideload Preparation
Prioritize tools that support "permanent signing + automatic JIT", recommended by priority:
1. **TrollStore** (Preferred): Supports permanent signing, automatic JIT enablement, and memory limit increase, compatible with some iOS versions, download from [Official Repository](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore)
2. **AltStore/SideStore** (Alternative): Requires periodic re-signing, initial setup requires computer/Wi-Fi; does not support "distribution certificate signing service", only compatible with "development certificate" (must include `com.apple.security.get-task-allow` permission to enable JIT)

> ⚠️ Security Tip: Only download sideloading tools and IPA from official/trusted sources; I am not responsible for device issues caused by unofficial software; Jailbroken devices support permanent signing, but daily jailbreaking is not recommended.


### 📥 Installation Steps
#### 1. Official Release (TrollStore Channel)
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/herbrine8403/Amethyst-iOS-MyRemastered/releases) to download the TIPA installation package
2. Through the system "share menu", choose to open with TrollStore to automatically complete installation

#### 2. Official Release (AltStore/SideStore Channel)
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/herbrine8403/Amethyst-iOS-MyRemastered/releases) to download the IPA installation package
2. (Normal installation steps)

#### 3. Nightly Test Version (Daily Build)
> 🔴 Risk Warning: Test versions may contain serious bugs such as crashes and failure to start, only for development testing!
1. Go to [GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/herbrine8403/Amethyst-iOS-MyRemastered/actions) to download the latest IPA test package
2. Import IPA in sideloading tools (AltStore/SideStore, etc.) to complete installation


### ⚡ Enable JIT (Required!)
JIT (Just-In-Time) is crucial for smooth game operation. iOS needs to enable it through the following tools, choose according to your environment:

| Tool | Requires External Device | Requires Wi-Fi | Auto Enable | Notes |
|--------------|------------|----------|----------|--------------------------|
| TrollStore | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Preferred, no additional action needed |
| AltStore | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Requires local network to run AltServer |
| SideStore | ✅ (First time) | ✅ (First time) | ❌ | Subsequent use requires no device/network |
| StikDebug | ✅ (First time) | ✅ (First time) | ✅ | Subsequent use requires no device/network |
| Jitterbug | ✅ (When VPN unavailable) | ✅ | ❌ | Requires manual trigger |
| Jailbroken Device | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | System-level automatic support |
