// SITE INVENTORY - what these counters DO and DO NOT cover.
//
// This list is the contract. A byte class that reads 0 while a real copy runs uncounted is
// worse than a missing counter, because the zero is then read as an answer, so every path
// that moves bytes and is NOT wired is named here by file and function.
//
// Byte classes
//   stage-buffer         ESPRYT (DirectGLES Managers.cpp): RespecifyStorageNow's
//                        glBufferData, FlushPendingRangesNow's three shapes (map-write,
//                        glBufferSubData, upload-ring stage), and the pool-recycle reseed
//                        in SyncBufferObject.
//                        MAGMA (DirectVulkan VkBufferManager.cpp): every host->device copy
//                        of a buffer object's contents - SwapStorageAndUploadAll, the
//                        StagedRangeCopy staging fill, the in-place uploads in OnRespecify /
//                        OnSubData / OnFlushMappedRange, the AcquirePersistentMap seed, the
//                        AcquireResidentSlice initial upload and the AcquireStreamedSlice
//                        arena fill.
//                        NOT covered IN A MONOLITH BUILD: bytes an app writes THROUGH a
//                        persistent map. Those never pass through either backend (D4/D-B4) -
//                        see persistent-map-push.
//                        COVERED UNDER SPLIT, AND DELIBERATELY OVERLAPPING WITH
//                        persistent-map-push (P5 b1, R-6). At adoption tier T2 there is no
//                        adoption, so a pushed block IS an ordinary resource_subdata: it
//                        reaches Ops_H_SubData, is queued into pendingRanges and is staged
//                        here like any other write. The same bytes are therefore in BOTH
//                        classes, on purpose - stage-buffer answers "what did the backend
//                        move", persistent-map-push answers "what did the client have to ship
//                        because the acquisition was declined", and subtracting one from the
//                        other would make the first under-report the thing it exists to
//                        measure. Read them as two questions about the same bytes, never as a
//                        partition, and do not add them.
//   stage-texture        ESPRYT (Managers.cpp texture upload): the bytes of whichever of
//                        the three upload shapes ran (rect list / union box / whole level).
//                        MAGMA (VkTextureManager.cpp): the packed staging slice of an
//                        upload batch item set.
//                        NOT covered: Espryt's compressed-texture path, and both backends'
//                        readback (device->host) paths, which are a different direction and
//                        want their own class when the reverse channel of section 7 exists.
//   stage-ubo-global     ESPRYT (DirectGLES.cpp): the default-uniform-block image, both the
//                        UBO-ring memcpy and the glBufferSubData fallback.
//                        MAGMA (UniformManager::ResolveDynamicUboDescriptor): the same
//                        image, counted after the per-frame slice memo, so a frame that
//                        re-uses the slice correctly contributes nothing.
//   stage-ubo-named      DirectVulkan UniformManager::ResolveUniformBufferPayload - the
//                        bytes Magma repacks into its own UBO ring, counted AFTER the
//                        zero-copy direct-bind decision (a direct bind repacks nothing).
//                        Espryt contributes nothing by construction (D-B8).
//   stage-vertex-client  ESPRYT: BackendVertexArrayObject::SyncClientSideAttributesFor-
//                        DrawArrays (both the Float64-narrowing and the verbatim shapes)
//                        and the VBO-backed Float64->Float32 narrowing scratch upload.
//                        MAGMA: VkBufferManager::UploadTransient(BufferKind::Vertex), which
//                        is the single chokepoint for the converted-vertex-stream and
//                        client-array staging.
//   stage-index-client   ESPRYT: the primitive-restart substitution buffer, and MultiDraw's
//                        rewritten (rebased) index stream.
//                        MAGMA: VkBufferManager::UploadTransient(BufferKind::Index).
//   stage-indirect-cmd   ESPRYT MultiDraw.cpp: the DrawElementsIndirectCommand array staged
//                        for the indirect tiers, and the compute tier's per-draw info
//                        array. Kept out of stage-index-client because these are draw
//                        PARAMETERS - the population that becomes MGPipe command-record
//                        payload, not resource bytes.
//                        NOT covered: Magma builds no such array (it issues one vkCmdDraw*
//                        per sub-draw), so this class is Espryt-only by construction.
//   persistent-map-push  WIRED IN P5 (b1), and only a split build can ever move it. The one
//                        site is BufferObject::PushMappedSpanBlock, i.e. the client shipping
//                        one MOBILEGL_IPC_PERSISTENT_BLOCK_KB block of a persistently mapped
//                        span because MGPipeApplyMapPersistent declined the adoption (R-6,
//                        tier T2). Zero in every monolith build, and that zero is CORRECT
//                        rather than missing: a persistent map there is a permanent address
//                        space donation (D4/D-B4), the application writes straight into GPU
//                        memory, and there is no push to count. A split run where this stays
//                        0 has NOT reached T2.
//                        Read it against map-persistent-roundtrips (mpr), which it is
//                        ANTI-CORRELATED with: mpr counts acquisition ATTEMPTS - one per
//                        storage definition, the same number in both modes - and this counts
//                        the bytes the client had to ship because the attempt was declined.
//                        DOUBLE-COUNTED WITH stage-buffer, deliberately: see that entry
//                        above. The two are different questions about the same bytes under
//                        split, and adding them is wrong.
//   residual-value-block Placeholder, always 0 until P2 (plan section 6.3).
//   stage-segment-bytes  P6 gate 8, and the only class in this list that is neither a backend's
//                        copy nor a client's blob declaration: it counts what the WIRE put into
//                        SEG_STAGE. One site, PipeWireEncoder::StageAllocate, which is the single
//                        allocation call behind PipeWireEncoder::StageBytes - so every writer
//                        (the buffer content walks, the texture slabs, the CSO archives, the
//                        storage-block names) is covered by construction rather than by being on
//                        a list. Align8 slack and the allocator's wrap skip are real occupancy
//                        and are deliberately NOT counted; see the ByteClass comment. It is a
//                        per-frame average by construction, so the per-blob SHAPE - the thing
//                        that says whether the chunk budget is cutting where it should - is the
//                        staged-blob histogram in the JSON dump, not this number.
//
// Call classes
//   draws                DirectGLES PrepareForDraw and DirectVulkan SetupDraw's entry. A
//                        dispatch is not a draw and is not counted.
//   wire-records         P6 gate 8: one per record the wire encoder COMMITTED, on
//                        PipeWireEncoder::EncodeRecord's successful path. Post-chunking by
//                        construction - an application call whose content is cut at
//                        MGPipeStageChunkBytes() produces several. A kRecPad ring filler is not a
//                        record and is not counted; an emission Reserve refused is counted once,
//                        when the retry succeeds. The emitter-side Client*Emissions counters
//                        answer a different question and the two together are what show what the
//                        suppressors absorbed.
//   accessor-calls       STATIC TALLIES at the instrumented entry points, NOT a wrapper
//                        around all 293 pGLContext-> sites. Each instrumented function adds
//                        the number of GLContext accessor calls that its OWN body executed
//                        on the path taken, and each tally sits AFTER the last early return
//                        that would skip those reads. Covered: PrepareForDraw's own reads,
//                        SyncRenderState, CaptureDrawTextureSyncKeys/CurrentUnitBindings-
//                        Epoch, SyncNeccessaryTextures' walk, TrySetupDrawFastPath,
//                        GetOrCreatePipeline and ApplyDynamicDrawStateTail. NOT covered:
//                        the reads inside the callees those functions invoke (buffer/VAO/
//                        FBO/program sync, the pipeline payload builder's ~40 reads on a
//                        memo miss), and every non-draw entry point. The number is
//                        therefore a LOWER BOUND on the per-draw accessor count, and it is
//                        the bound over exactly the six gates section 2.3.1 tabulates.
//   texture-*            Per (target, level) emission, both backends.
//
// Gates: the six of section 2.3.1, each counted exactly once per probe.
//
// READING acc/draw. The accessor tally covers the instrumented functions wherever they
// run, and three of them (SyncRenderState, the texture-key capture, SyncNeccessaryTextures)
// are also reached from NON-draw call sites - Clear, readbacks, the DSA by-name entry
// points - which the `draws` counter deliberately does not count. So acc/draw is the
// per-draw steady-state number section 2.3.1 asks for only in a DRAW-DOMINATED window; in a
// window dominated by clears and readbacks it is inflated by exactly those non-draw
// probes, and the gate hit/miss pairs are the honest reading there.
