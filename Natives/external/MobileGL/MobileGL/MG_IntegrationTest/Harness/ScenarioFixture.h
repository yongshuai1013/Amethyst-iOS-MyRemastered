// The base fixture every scenario derives from. Its only jobs are to bring the
// headless context up once per process and to decide what "this machine has no
// usable GPU" means.
//
// By default it means a clean GTEST_SKIP() - never a failure, never a hang -
// because a developer box or a container without a GPU should not fail a run it
// was never able to perform. But a skip is indistinguishable from a pass in
// every CI summary, so the `integration-gpu` label on its own is unfalsifiable:
// a runner whose driver pinning silently broke reports the same green as one
// that rendered every frame. MOBILEGL_ITEST_REQUIRE_GPU is the caller saying
// "this machine HAS a GPU and I am relying on these scenarios actually running";
// with it set, an unusable harness is a FAILURE carrying the pre-flight's reason.

    // How a MOBILEGL_* quirk variable reads in THIS process's environment.
    //
    // A scenario that needs a non-default configuration takes it from here and skips
    // when the process it was launched into is not in that configuration, rather than
    // writing MG_Config::Features itself. Two reasons, and the second one decides it:
    //
    //   - the feature table is an internal symbol. On Android this module links against
    //     the SHIPPING libMobileGL.so - deliberately, so the on-device run validates the
    //     real artifact - and that library is built -fvisibility=hidden, so nothing
    //     internal is reachable from here at all.
    //   - a quirk poked in-process is already too late for everything latched at
    //     initialization: the compile pool and its threads, and the backend's advertised
    //     extension list, which is built once from the configuration in force at first
    //     use. The process-wide variable is the only spelling that covers the whole
    //     configuration instead of the half of it that is still mutable afterwards.
    //
    // The reading rule is MG_ConfigLoader's, character for character (ConfigLoader.cpp,
    // QueryEnvQuirkOverride / IsTruthyValue): unset is Auto - device auto-detection or a
    // built-in default, i.e. a value only the implementation knows - a truthy value is
    // On, and anything else that IS set ("0", "false", "") is Off.
