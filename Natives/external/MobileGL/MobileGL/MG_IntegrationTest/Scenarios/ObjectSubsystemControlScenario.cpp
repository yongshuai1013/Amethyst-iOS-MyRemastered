// Scenario - THE P4a SUBSYSTEM A/B IS REAL, AND ITS DEPENDENCY REFUSALS ARE EXERCISED (gate G12).
//
// P4a migrates FOUR subsystems (D-K1, MG_Pipe/MGPipe.h):
//
//   bit  9  kMGPipeSubsystemFramebuffer       set_framebuffer_state
//   bit 10  kMGPipeSubsystemTextureResources  texture + renderbuffer resource_*, set_texture_params
//   bit 11  kMGPipeSubsystemSamplers          sampler CSO, sampler view, the three unit sets
//   bit 12  kMGPipeSubsystemPrograms          shader CSO, draw/dispatch program, global constants
//
// so the push build's default mask becomes kMGPipeSubsystemsMigratedAtP4a = 0x1fff, and P3a's
// 0x1ff survives as the control that clears exactly those four - MGPipe.h's rule that every phase's
// constant keeps meaning what it meant, so an operator's recorded mask is still readable a phase
// later. THE OFF LANE IS 0x1ff AND NOT A HAND-PICKED PATTERN, for that reason.
//
// That A/B is what every "push vs pull" number in MEASUREMENTS.md is taken against, and it has one
// characteristic failure mode: the bits stop steering anything, both arms run the same code, and
// every later comparison is quietly taken against a switch that does nothing. This file is the
// entry that cannot let that happen. It is the P4a analogue of ResourceSubsystemControlScenario and
// deliberately its twin in shape.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS, per lane:
//
//   on  (MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH=0x1fff)
//       The client emits P4a's records for the workload: a framebuffer state per bound target that
//       moved, the three unit sets, and the client-side texture upload record. The window's
//       emit[fbe= sve= sse= sie= ctu=] bracket therefore carries a NON-ZERO total.
//
//   off (MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH=0x1ff, P3a's default = P4a's four subsystems cleared)
//       The frontend dispatch falls through to the legacy MGB_CTX-reading arms, nothing is emitted
//       through any of the four families, and every one of those five counters must read ZERO.
//       This is the reading a dead switch fails: with the bits ignored, this lane would report the
//       same non-zero counts as the other one.
//
//   refused (MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH=0x9ff = bits 0..8 plus bit 11, samplers, WITHOUT bit 10)
//       D-K2's dependency refusal. Every MGPBoundView::Texture and MGPImageView::Res names a
//       Texture handle and only bit 10 populates the texture slot table, so a sampler subsystem
//       without it would miss every lookup and walk on without unbinding. The bring-up logs ONE
//       error naming BOTH bits, refuses bit 11 and runs the legacy sampler arm - modelled on the
//       bit-8-requires-bit-7 refusal that already ships (Managers.cpp:2393-2410). The assertion is
//       that the refusal is NAMED and that the run then produces the same pixels as any other
//       lane: a refusal that half-ran, or that aborted, would both be failures here.
//
//   refused-texture (MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH=0x5ff = bits 0..8 plus bit 10, texture resources, WITHOUT
//       bit 11)
//       D-K2's FOURTH row (ID-15), and the direction the brief originally called harmless.
//       MGPTextureParams::BuiltinSampler is a SamplerCso HANDLE and only bit 11 mints sampler
//       CSOs, so with bit 10 alone every set_texture_params would carry a null there and the
//       applier's Fatal{ProtocolCorruption} is the next thing that happens. Same two assertions
//       as the lane above, with the two bits' roles swapped.
//
//   both refusal lanes
//       "NAMED" means ONE LINE of the library's log, at ERROR severity, that says it REFUSED and
//       names both bits. Not a substring anywhere in the file: the word "sampler" appears in
//       almost any log the sampler path writes to, and an assertion that cannot go red for its
//       stated reason is worse than no assertion (review F-M6).
//
//   every lane
//       THE PIXELS MUST NOT MOVE. The workload draws one solid-colour quad through a texture, an
//       explicit sampler object and a user framebuffer, and every lane must read back that colour.
//       "The counters moved and the picture did not" is the whole claim - a switch that changed
//       what is drawn would not be an A/B, it would be a bug.
//
// WHY IT CAN SKIP. The counters are emitted by the client-side emitters P4a packages B and C own,
// and this file is written against the P4a contract commit, before either lands. Until then nothing
// emits, the five counters are structurally zero in BOTH lanes, and an assertion about the
// difference would be a statement about nothing. The build answers the question rather than a
// hand-maintained list: MG_IntegrationTest/CMakeLists.txt greps every source under MG_Impl/Pipe/
// for the counters' names and passes the answer in as MGITEST_PIPE_OBJECT_EMITTER_PRESENT, with a
// CONFIGURE_DEPENDS on that directory and on each file it finds so the answer cannot go stale. It
// is a CONTENT probe, not a filename probe, so the owning packages keep control of their own file
// layout - P4a's new client files are headers (D-P), and a glob for a named .cpp would have kept
// this control skipping forever with a reason that had become false.
//
// DIRECTGLES ONLY, and that is the honest scope: P4a migrates Espryt's framebuffer, texture,
// sampler and program paths. Magma's are P7 (D-Q) and register nothing here, so a DirectVulkan lane
// would be measuring the client emitters against a backend nobody asked to change.

        //     one record per line (MG_Util/Debug/Log.cpp), and D-K2 asks for an MGLOG_E. A refusal

        //     mistaken for the decision;

        // (1c36987e, ID-P7-28) that helper reads the family's row from MG_Pipe/SubsystemDeps.def
        // instead of taking one hand-written dependency bit, and it computes the missing bits
        // rather than naming them: "MGPipe: <A> (bit N) is set but MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH=0x<mask>
        // does not carry every bit MG_Pipe/SubsystemDeps.def says it requires (requires 0x<R>,
        // missing 0x<M>): <why> - REFUSING the dependent bit and running the legacy arm. Set every
        // bit of the row, or clear the family's own". The SET bit is accepted in three spellings -
        // the constant's name, "(bit N)", and the hexadecimal mask - and the NEEDED bit is read
        // from the one place the helper names it, the "missing 0x<M>)" field, so the assertion
        // pins the DECISION and the DIRECTION, and not the family-specific prose in <why>.
        //
        // THE OLD SENTENCE ("<A> (bit N) is set but <B> (bit M) is clear; ...") IS GONE FROM THE
        // TREE, and this matcher used to require its " is clear": after D3 both refusal lanes went
        // red with the refusal sitting on the ERROR line the lane was reading (CI run
        // 35792628470 onward). Nothing about the decision changed - only the wording did.
        //
        // THE DIRECTION IS THE HALF THIS FILE USED TO BE MISSING (review F-v2-m1). The first form
        // of the matcher asked "does the line name bit A?" AND "does the line name bit B?", which
        // is a SYMMETRIC conjunction: swapping the two arguments - exactly what separates the
        // 0x5ff case from the 0x9ff one below, and what each of their comments claims to be
        // doing - could not change the answer, and both cases went green on either line. A
        // resolver that refused correctly but printed the MIRROR sentence would have been green
        // on a refusal that told the operator the wrong dependency, which is the same class of
        // "the log says something plausible" defect that made the whole-file substring search

        // away at all times.

        // parenthesis, so "missing 0x400)" cannot be satisfied by "missing 0x4000)" (bit 14), and

        // BRIEF-P4A.md's D-K2 says "bit 10 without bit 11 is fine", and that sentence is wrong for
        // P4a AS BUILT: MGPTextureParams carries a BuiltinSampler, which is a SamplerCso HANDLE,
        // and only bit 11 mints sampler CSOs - c0b's four unconditional mints deliberately exclude
        // that kind (contract-v2.md), and package C content-addresses them through its own cache
        // (ID-14). With bit 10 set and bit 11 clear every set_texture_params would therefore carry
        // a NULL BuiltinSampler, which the applier treats as Fatal{ProtocolCorruption} (wire H1),
        // and minting it client-side in the arm that exists to exclude samplers was rejected. So

        // bit 10 above and bit 8 without bit 7 one phase earlier. ID-15 puts the refusal in the
        // texture family's Resolve*SubsystemArm - package D's Managers.cpp - and this case is the
        // pin that says it is there.
