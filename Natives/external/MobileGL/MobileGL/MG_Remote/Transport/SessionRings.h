// The ring-owning half of a session: the four segments, the two ring endpoints,
// and the five watermarks. Owner: package s1.
//
// This is the object the P5 gate is really about. ROADMAP.md:21 asks that
// `inproc` run THE SAME G3 codec as `spawn`, and InProcessTransport cannot
// deliver that no matter how it is edited: it is two deque<vector<uint8_t>> plus
// two condvar doorbells (InProcessTransport.cpp:38-97), it owns THE BELLS BUT
// NOT THE RING, and it runs no codec at all. So the rings live here, above
// ITransport, in one implementation both delivery modes use - and the transport
// supplies the control plane and the two bells, which is exactly what its own
// header says it is for (ITransport.h:16-20: "everything on the hot path
// bypasses this interface entirely").
//
// INPROC USES ShmSegment TOO, NOT new[]. In one address space a heap allocation
// would work and would be faster to write. It is refused deliberately: it is half
// of what makes "the same code path" true rather than nominal. A `new` here means
// the mapping, the alignment, the size rounding, the read-only peer view and the
// lifetime are all exercised for the first time in P6, on the day the second
// process appears - which is the shape of every "it was green in CI" failure this
// phase is trying not to repeat.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE KNOB NAMES THE RING; THE SEGMENT IS THE RING PLUS ONE CONTROL PAGE.
//
// Ring.h:11-13 puts RingControl at the HEAD of SEG_CMD and RingProducer requires
// a POWER-OF-TWO capacity (Ring.cpp:89-103 - the mask IS the indexing). Those two
// facts together mean a segment and its ring cannot both be 8 MiB, and one of the
// two numbers has to give.
//
// The one that gives is the SEGMENT: SEG_CMD is `MOBILEGL_IPC_RING_MB` MiB PLUS
// 4096, so the ring inside it is exactly MOBILEGL_IPC_RING_MB MiB and
// RingProducer::MaxRecordBytes() is exactly half of that. CONTRACT-P5 §5 and
// Config.h's MOBILEGL_IPC_RING_MB comment - "A RECORD MAY BE AT MOST HALF OF
// THIS, so 8 MiB caps one record at 4 MiB" - are then TRUE AS WRITTEN, which
// matters because that sentence is what every other package sizes against.
//
// The first version of this file did the opposite: an 8 MiB segment with a 4 MiB
// ring and a 2 MiB record cap, on the grounds that ProtocolSmokeTest.cpp:72 pinned
// the four announced sizes. That was wrong on the facts - that test builds four
// SegmentRefs from its own literals and round-trips them through the schema; it
// says nothing about what a session announces, and it never mentions
// SessionSegments at all. So the alternative was available at no cost, and the
// version that made two live documents false and left half of SEG_CMD mapped and
// unreachable was the worse of the two.
//
// SegmentRef.sizeBytes therefore announces the MAPPING size (ring + page), which
// is what a spawn peer must mmap. The four numbers a reader recognises - 8 MiB /
// 32 MiB / 16 MiB / 256 KiB (ID-47) - are the RING sizes, which is what the
// knobs name.
//
// SEG_STAGE has no control page of its own: RingControl carries TWO cursor
// triples (Ring.h:101-109) and the stage triple is the second. So SEG_STAGE is
// exactly its ring, and 32 MiB is already a power of two. SEG_REPLY is not a ring
// at all.
