// The client's copy of the server's capabilities. Owner: package c1. Signatures by c0.
//
// WHY A MIRROR AND NOT A ROUND TRIP. There are 56 client-side caps read points
// (40 GetDynamicParameters + 7 GetRendererInfo + 4 GetFormatCapabilities + 3 GetBackendType +
// 2 GetBackendAPIVersionString), and several of them - GL_Getter.cpp:2400 and
// ShaderTranspiler/CompileEnv.cpp:120-124 - bind a reference and then read many members, so a
// partial snapshot is not an option. Every one of the 56 must be answerable locally, with no
// record on the wire.
//
// GetRendererInfo() RETURNS A REFERENCE (BackendObject.h:590), so the mirror must OWN a
// RendererInfo instance to hand back - including before the first snapshot arrives, because
// LogBackendInfo() reads it at MG_Backend/Init.cpp:21, during MG_Backend::Init(), long before
// any context exists. Ruling (scout-caps-reply §1.2 option (a)): the mirror answers with a
// placeholder until the first snapshot, P5 accepts one inaccurate startup log line, and
// MG_Backend::Init() is NOT restructured.
//
// GetFormatCapabilities() is NON-VIRTUAL (BackendObject.h:594), so a remote backend object
// cannot override the accessor: it must FILL BackendObject::m_formatCapabilities from this
// mirror instead.
//
// INVALIDATION IS RE-ARRIVAL (R-12). DirectGLES has no OnCapsInvalidated producer at all - it
// re-runs UpdateAdvertisedCapabilityExtensions + UpdateDynamicBackendParameters at
// BackendObject_DirectGLES.cpp:865-871 and tells the frontend nothing, which is correct in
// monolith and a silent bug under split. Rather than add a DirectGLES-side callback (a
// dev-shaped backend edit), the SERVER re-sends the whole snapshot on every InitCapabilities
// re-run and the CLIENT treats a second arrival as the invalidation. Generation() is what a
// client-side memo keys on, and it is also the re-open signal for the server-context-death
// case that MGPipeCallbacks has no eleventh slot for (MGPipeCallbacks.h:56-58).

    //     this call blocks, and a wait there would burn the budget and then die anyway;
