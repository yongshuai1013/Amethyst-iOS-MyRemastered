"""Exercise a real TCP supervisor's LISTEN, Busy, token, version, build-policy and REAP controls.

P7 wave 0 registered this script as `TcpLane.SupervisorProtocolControls` in
MG_IntegrationTest/CMakeLists.txt. Until then it was referenced by NOTHING in the tree - no
ctest entry, no workflow step - so the four controls it asserts had been green or red for an
unknown number of commits and nobody would have known which.

P7 wave 2-F, PH-7 (1)(2)(3) (ID-P7-3), added the two LISTEN controls at the top of main(). They
are the negative controls for the policy AuthToken.h now owns, and both are end-to-end against a
real supervisor process because that is the only place the policy is reachable: an in-process
unit test of `SocketTransport::Listen` can assert the return code but not that an operator who
misconfigured a token gets a dead server with a named reason rather than a live one that silently
serves loopback only.

P7 F2, PH-7 (5): the supervisor now reads and authenticates every first frame before it forks, so
the controls here assert that an unauthenticated peer learns nothing of ours
(`unauthenticated_wrong_layout`), that a silent one costs no fork and is answered at the pre-auth
deadline (`silent_peer`), that Busy is the answer to an AUTHENTICATED second client (`busy`), the
pending cap and the backoff (`pending_cap`, `auth_backoff`), and ID-P7-44's queued-DataBind
refusal (`data_bind_queued_before_bound`). The f2-auth fix round added that the pending queue is
shared between addresses (`pending_queue_is_shared`) and that an address holding slots with silent
connections is backed off (`silent_slot_holder_backed_off`), that routing DataBinds does not stall
the supervisor (`data_bind_routing_does_not_stall`), and that a child which refuses its Hello
refuses the DataBinds queued to it (`data_bind_queued_before_refused_hello`, ID-P7-44), and that
running out of descriptors pauses accepting instead of ending the supervisor
(`accept_out_of_descriptors`). The five
malformed-frame shapes are fuzz arm 1's own entry, scripts/ci/ph_fuzz_control_frames.py.

It needs flatc, which is deliberately absent from the default build graph (gen_protocol.py's
header block says why). Resolution order is gen_protocol.py's, minus the build-it-for-you arm:
--flatc, then $MOBILEGL_FLATC_EXECUTABLE, then <repo>/../flatc-build/flatc. With none of them
the script exits kSkipExit and ctest reports SKIP - loudly absent rather than quietly passing,
which is the failure mode a gate nothing references already had.
