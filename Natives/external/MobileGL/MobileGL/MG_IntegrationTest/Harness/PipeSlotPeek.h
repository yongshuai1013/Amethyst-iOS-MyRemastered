// The CLIENT slot allocator's occupancy, read from a scenario.
//
// It exists for one assertion, P3a's C-1: a frontend object that dies must return its
// MGPipeHandle slot WHATEVER BACKEND IS RUNNING. That question has no answer in the GL API -
// the leak it rules out is entirely inside the library, and it is invisible in pixels, in GL
// names and in `glGetError` - so the only honest observable is the allocator's own live count
// and high-water mark. Reading them is what makes the case fail on the backend it actually
// failed on (DirectVulkan, which at P3a installed no StateObjectDeathOps) rather than only on
// the one where a backend-owned free happened to exist.
//
// P7 wave 2 package C: DirectVulkan now installs a table of its own (CONTRACT-P7 §5.5), and
// the sentence above is history rather than the current state - but the reason this header
// exists is UNCHANGED and is worth spelling out, because the obvious reading of that news is
// wrong. Magma's table does not free a client slot and never could: the free is P4a's, it
// runs from the frontend object's own destructor on the client thread whatever backend is
// live (MG_Impl/Pipe/PipeFill.cpp's NotifyAndFree), and Magma's table is the EMIT arm that
// tells the SERVER to drop its twin. So the allocator is still the only observable of the
// client half, and a case that reads `deaths` alone would be blind to a slot that never came
// back. The two readings belong together, which is what CtWireScenario's framebuffer case now
// does.
//
// A separate translation unit for BackendCapsPeek.h's reason, verbatim: the scenario sources
// include the GL headers with prototypes and MobileGL's umbrella header is not meant to meet
// them in one file.
