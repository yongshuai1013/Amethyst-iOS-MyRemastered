// The DATA-plane seam. Declared by package c6, implemented by package lk.
// Authority: CONTRACT-P6.md §8.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT IS NOT ITransport. ITransport.h:16-20 says in its
// own header that everything on the hot path bypasses it: it carries the
// handshake, surface ops, resync, aux requests and fatals, and that scope is
// already correct for a socket. Below it there was NO interface of any kind -
// Ring.h, ReplySlot.h and EventRing.h each take a raw `void* base` plus a
// capacity, so "swap the transport" had nothing to swap. This header is that
// missing thing, and ITransport is neither extended nor changed by it.
//
// NOTHING INCLUDES THIS FILE IN c6. That is the whole of c6's behaviour
// guarantee: the seam is declared, StreamLink.h is declared against it (which
// is the adequacy proof - see below), and not one call site moves. Package lk
// implements ShmLink by relocating today's SessionSegments / Ring /
// ReplySlotPool / EventRing behind it, line for line, and only then rewrites
// the call sites.
//
// THE SEAM IS SETUP-TIME, NOT HOT-PATH. No method here is called per record,
// per publish, or inside a spin predicate. The producer takes a LinkArena once
// at attach and reserves through it non-virtually; every wait predicate reads
// LinkProgress through a raw pointer taken once. Three grounds, the second
// decisive (CONTRACT-P6.md §8.2):
//
//   1. Two virtuals per record at the 4000 records/frame SEG_CMD is sized
//      against is ~8000 indirect calls/frame, about 0.5% of the measured
//      15.72 ms client frame - affordable, but the only lane that could
//      measure it has +/-4% dispersion, EIGHT TIMES the effect. A gate that
//      can only ever print "within noise" is ID-124's failure mode one level
//      down.
//   2. Doorbell::Wait is a non-virtual template whose spin loop calls ready()
//      up to SpinItersPerUs() * spinUs times; at 916 waits/frame with 99.8%
//      resolved inside the spin, the predicate runs 1e5-1e6 times per frame
//      and reads the watermarks straight off the shared page. That is the
//      31.58%-of-the-GL-thread path. A virtual there is not a rounding
//      question.
//   3. The encode path already depends on four inline accessors around its one
//      Reserve; virtualising Reserve alone forces either four more virtuals or
//      moving R-10's wrap counters behind the seam, and those are deliberately
//      encoder-owned.
//
// So lk's gate is an objdump call-count of the encode path, not a wall clock:
// after lk that path has no more out-of-line calls than before. That is
// falsifiable; "within noise" is not.
//
// WHAT THIS HEADER DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.
//   - It does not define Watermark::Reached or any other predicate that
//     SessionRings.h already defines. One definition, one owner.
//   - It does not relocate the bodies of RingProducer::Reserve or
//     RingConsumer::Pop. Those log (MGLOG_E / MGLOG_D) and use Align8 and
//     <cstring>; no header under Transport/ pulls the logger in, and this one
//     does not start. They stay out of line and move to ShmLink.cpp in lk.
//   - It declares no function it does not define. Every entry point here is
//     pure virtual or a POD accessor.
//   - It does not regroup RingControl. That regroup is real and necessary
//     (CONTRACT-P6.md §8.3) but its rename blast radius is 109 production
//     sites, five of them behind a non-Android #if, so it is lk's with a
//     published per-file itemisation - not a side effect of declaring a seam.

    //
    // The watermarks every wait predicate reads. On ShmLink this aliases the
    // shared control page and the loads are cross-process acquire loads; on
    // StreamLink it is process-local and a reader thread stores into it from
    // decoded progress messages.
    //
    // THE RULES SURVIVE THE MECHANISM VERBATIM, and that is the point of naming
    // the block rather than the page: late-never-early (Ring.h's "BATCHING MAY ONLY MAKE A WATERMARK LATE"), `>=`
    // never `==` (SessionRings.h's Watermark::Reached), monotone with a
    // backwards move Fatal (Ring.cpp's AdvanceMonotonic). A stream link changes
    // only HOW a value arrives, never what it means.
    //
    // WHY THESE FOUR AND NOT THE WHOLE PAGE, AND WHY THE EVENT FLAGS ARE NOT
    // HERE. RingControl's watermark cache line HELD, until lk regrouped it, {appliedSeq,
    // submittedSeq, retiredSeq, completedFrameSerial, presentAckSerial}, and
    // submittedSeq is PRODUCER-written (Ring.h's "THE FIVE WATERMARKS" block,
    // "Advanced by the PRODUCER after it publishes") while the other four are consumer-written - so the
    // line has MIXED WRITERS as it stands and no single-writer block can be
    // aliased over it. lk's regroup moves submittedSeq out to the producer's
    // own line, beside cmdHead, which is the other thing the producer writes;
    // what is left IS this struct, and it IS a named member of RingControl,
    // pinned there by per-field offsetof static_asserts (Ring.h).
    //
    // THE TWO EVENT FLAGS ARE DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED, and an earlier draft of
    // this header had them in and was wrong. eventRingFull has TWO writers:
    // the server latches it with store(1) when SEG_EVENT fills
    // (EventRing.h:140) and the CLIENT clears it with an exchange(0) on EVERY
    // DRAIN (EventRing.h:200). Promoting it here would put a per-drain RMW by
    // the client on the same cache line as appliedSeq - which the server
    // release-stores every 64 records and the client's spin predicate reads
    // 1e5-1e6 times per frame. That is new false sharing on the hottest line
    // in the system, and it would land in exactly the numbers lk's gate has to
    // hold constant. They stay in the doorbell/generation group, where mixed
    // writers already live beside consumerParked/producerParked, and cross the
