// Scenario - A PERSISTENT|WRITE|COHERENT MAPPING, WRITTEN THROUGH WITH NO GL CALL ANNOUNCING IT.
//
// Target C of P5's reduced path, spelled out in full at docs/Disaggregated/ARCHITECTURE.md section 12:
// map PERSISTENT|WRITE|COHERENT, write through the pointer, MAKE NO OTHER GL CALL, draw, read
// back and check.
//
// THE "NO OTHER GL CALL" IS THE ENTIRE POINT and it is exit gate E3(b). Under the split shape the
// server has no access to the client's address space, so a coherent mapping that the application
// writes into is bytes nobody told anyone about: the client tracker has to push the dirty blocks
// at EVERY VALIDATE POINT, on its own initiative, because no glBufferSubData, no
// glFlushMappedBufferRange and no unmap will ever come. A scenario that slipped in one announcing
// call - even a glGetError between the write and the draw - would let a "push on the next explicit
// buffer operation" implementation pass, which is the implementation this gate exists to reject.
// So the write/draw pairs below are exactly `std::memcpy(...)` followed by `glDrawArrays(...)`
// with nothing in between, and the sequence is map, write, draw, WRITE AGAIN, draw again, read
// back: the second write is the one that cannot have been carried by anything the first one did.
//
// WHICH ARM IS THIS RUNNING ON. A scenario-sized buffer is far below the 16 MiB
// kLargeBufferAdoptBytes, so BufferObject::TryAdoptLargeStorage never fires here - but
// AcquireMemoryRange has an adoption of its OWN that fires for any PERSISTENT|WRITE map that is
// not FLUSH_EXPLICIT (BufferObject.cpp:645-661). So the same test lands in the ADOPTED arm (the
// resource owner minted host-visible coherent storage, the CPU shadow was released, the
// application writes straight into GPU-visible memory) or in the EMULATED arm (the owner
// declined, the shadow is the truth, and the client has to push blocks) depending on driver and
// build - and those are completely different code paths. MOBILEGL_DISABLE_LARGE_BUFFER_ADOPTION
// does NOT separate them: it guards the 16 MiB path this buffer never reaches.
//
// So the lane DECLARES the arm (MGITEST_PERSISTENT_MAP_ARM, Harness/SplitLane.h) and
// TheMapLandsInTheArmItsLaneDeclares asserts it landed there, reading the library's own summary
// line. R-6 pins the split arm at T2 = emulated. The observable that separates them is
// `pmap` (persistent-map-push bytes, PipeStats ByteClass::PersistentMapPush): a push happens if
// and only if the acquisition was DECLINED, so pmap > 0 IS the black-box spelling of exit gate
// E3(d), "MGPipeApplyMapPersistent never returns a non-null pointer under split". It is the only
// spelling available from here - an adopted inproc store still renders correctly, because the
// address really is valid in this process, which is precisely why E3(d) is worth gating at all -
// and a direct count of declines would need a counter from packages b1/v1.
//
// AND MEMBERSHIP FOLLOWS THE ARM (ID-42). The client's live-persistent-map set is the set of maps
// the client still has to PUSH, so an ADOPTED store is deliberately not in it -
// PersistentMapTracker::IsLivePersistentMap's second row is IsBackendPersistentMapped(), and an
// adopted store's bytes are already in coherent GPU memory. AssertMembership therefore expects
// `live == (arm == emulated)`, from the same peek AssertOrRecordArm reads. The arm-INDEPENDENT
// claim - "the predicate reads the chain, not the adopt tier" - belongs to a unit case that can
// drive both answers on demand (SplitBufferSet.
// TheAdoptedArmIsNotAMemberAndItIsTheChainRowThatSaysSo) and not to an integration entry, which
// only ever sees whichever arm its driver and transport happen to give it.
//
// `mpr` (map-persistent-roundtrips) is counted per ACQUISITION ATTEMPT, mint or decline
// (ARCHITECTURE.md:492), so it is the SAME NUMBER on both arms and in both transports: that is
// what makes exit gate E3(c)'s "mpr equal to the monolith arm's" checkable by one process. Both
// lanes assert the same constant against the same workload, so the equality holds by
// construction and each lane can fail on its own.
