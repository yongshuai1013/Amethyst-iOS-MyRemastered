// SEG_REPLY: the slot pool the server writes a kReplySlot answer into, and the
// client reads it back out of. Owner: package s1.
//
// THE ID IS THE RECORD SEQUENCE NUMBER (P5 R-3). There is no second id space and
// no allocator: the ten kReplySlot calls carry no MGPReplySlot in their payloads
// (that is why the id has to be DERIVED rather than carried), the wire has no
// per-record seq field (ARCHITECTURE.md:124), so the record's ordinal IS its
// reply-slot id. The slot is addressed `seq % slotCount` and the server STAMPS
// THE SEQ BACK INTO THE SLOT HEADER, which is what makes a wrong-slot read
// detectable rather than merely plausible. Seq is 1-based; 0 means "no record".
//
// THE SLOT HEADER IS CONTRACT-P5 TABLE 0's ROW, verbatim:
//     { Uint64 Seq; Int32 Status; Uint32 Size; }   // 16 bytes, then the payload
//     Status: 0 = OK, 1 = DECLINED, 2 = ERROR
//
// DECLINED IS A REAL ANSWER, NOT A FAILURE. It is how MapPersistent says nullptr
// (R-6) and how the four Bool acceptance entry points - ResourceCreate,
// ResourceRespecify, ResourceSubData, SetTextureParams - say false (R-5). A
// client that folds DECLINED into "the call failed" re-creates ID-39's 66 lost
// uploads from the other side, and a client that folds it into OK accepts a
// pointer the server never handed out.
//
// A REPLY LARGER THAN ONE SLOT IS FATAL, NOT CHUNKED, AND THE CLIENT SAYS SO
// FIRST (ID-47). P5's only large answer is ReadPixels, and the client knows its
// size before it emits the record, so it refuses an oversize ANSWER BY NAME
// before emission (RequireReadPixelsFits: Fatal{ReplyTooLarge, "ReadPixels
// <w>x<h> <format> <bytes> > <cap>"}); Post's own refusal is the server's last
// line of defence, and reaching it means the two sides disagree about the frame
// rather than that the pool is too small. The pool still has no knob and a reply
// is still never chunked: since P7 gate 5 (g5-readback) the client splits a READ
// larger than one slot into bands, each an ordinary read_pixels record whose
// answer fits (EmitTables.h PlanReadbackBands), so the refusal is left for the
// one read no banding can answer - a single pixel larger than a slot.
//
// ORDERING. The client only looks at a slot after it has seen
// RingControl::appliedSeq >= its own seq with an ACQUIRE load, and the server
// advances appliedSeq with a RELEASE store AFTER posting the reply
// (PipeApplier::ApplyOne's order: decode -> stamp -> apply -> post -> advance).
// That pair is what publishes the slot's bytes; the fences below are the
// belt-and-braces for a caller - a unit test, or P9's async pool - that reads a
// slot without going through appliedSeq first.

// P9's account, named here rather than left to be rediscovered: the seq stamp
// catches a sequence space drifted by anything that is NOT a multiple of
// slotCount. A drift of exactly 8, 16, ... lands on the same slot with a matching
// stamp and reads as this call's answer. Under R-1's verb barrier the in-flight
// depth is one and a drift cannot open at all; P9 is what removes the barrier,
// and it is what has to widen the stamp (a generation beside the seq) or bound
// the drift some other way.

    // Why eight and not sixty-four: while the verb barrier holds (R-1) the client
    // blocks at every verb boundary, so the in-flight depth is exactly ONE and
    // every extra slot buys nothing but a smaller maximum answer. The trade is

    // asynchronous, re-chooses this geometry with real depth to size it against.
    //
    // WHY 2 MiB AND NOT 1. The first version of this file said "1 MiB covers a
    // 512x512 RGBA8 read", and it did not: 512*512*4 is exactly 1 MiB and the
    // slot header takes 16 of those bytes, so Post refused it by sixteen. Worse,
    // the E2 retrace harness's snapshot is a full-surface GL_RGBA/GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE
    // read of OpenRA's 640x480 surface = 1,228,800 bytes through the interposer,
    // 17% over the old cap - Post would have aborted on the first snapshot the
    // day the client's ReadPixels emitter landed. Contract §2 row 23 says the
    // slot is "sized from the scenario's largest read rather than guessed";
    // 2 MiB is that size for every P5 exit-gate read (E2 is the largest at
    // 640x480). A 2400x1080 RGBA8 device surface is ~10.4 MB and is a P6 debt
    // (chunked readback or a dedicated readback carrier), recorded in the
