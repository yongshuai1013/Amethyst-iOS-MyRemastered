// WHETHER THIS PROCESS IS REALLY RUNNING SPLIT, asked of the process rather than of the source
// tree. This is what arms every `DirectGLES.Split.` entry.
//
// WHY IT REPLACED A CONTENT PROBE, and the lesson is worth the paragraph. The first version of
// this arming condition was a CMake `file(STRINGS ... REGEX)` conjunction: "some source under
// MG_Remote/Client names the c1 symbols AND no source under Client or Server still matches
// `Fatal.Unimplemented`". Review finding M-1 did not argue with it, it PERFORMED it: a
// `sed -i 's/Fatal{Unimplemented/Fatal{NotYetImplemented/'` over c0's six stub files - every
// entry point still ending in std::abort(), RemoteEmitTable() still aborting on sight,
// ImplementedVerbCount() still returning 0 - armed all eleven lanes and EIGHT OF THEM WENT GREEN
// having run monolith end to end. A comment line containing the marker did the opposite and kept
// them dark forever (M-2), and two further stub files outside the two probed directories made a
// partial arm possible (M-3).
//
// The general form of that defect: A STATEMENT ABOUT SOURCE TEXT CAN ALWAYS BE FALSIFIED BY
// EDITING SOURCE TEXT, and the people most likely to edit it are the ones landing the packages
// the probe is watching for. A statement about what the process actually did cannot. So the three
// facts below are read out of the running process, and each is structurally impossible in a
// monolith build:
//
//   1. `MG_Config::Transport != Monolith`. In a build without MOBILEGL_BUILD_DISAGGREGATED,
//      `Transport` is a `constexpr` Monolith (Config.h:514) and this whole translation unit is
//      compiled out. Read from the VARIABLE, never from a log line - the log-grep spelling of
//      this question is satisfied by a DEBUG-level pull build's `Config: Accepted env variable:
//      MOBILEGL_TRANSPORT=inproc` (review finding M-5).
//   2. `ClientSession::Active() != nullptr`. c0 made this one deliberately return null rather
//      than Fatal, because "does a session exist" has a legitimate "no" - it is the monolith
//      answer (ClientSession.cpp:31). So it is exactly "a client session exists in this process",
//      and no amount of editing stub MESSAGES makes a null pointer non-null.
//   3. `ImplementedVerbCount() > 0`. c0's stub returns 0; the contract gives this function the
//      job of making "a table that silently lost an emitter" distinguishable from "a table that
//      never had one" (EmitTables.h). Zero means there is no emitter to test.
//
// And one BEHAVIOURAL fact, which is the half that says the run went through the wire rather than
// merely that it could have: `ClientSession::Active()->Encoder().EmitSeq()`, the highest record
// ordinal this client has produced. A scenario that armed, drew, and emitted nothing has a
// sequence that did not move, and that is the shape of an emit table that resolves the transport
// and then falls through to the driver.
//
// Every entry point returns false, touching nothing, where the state is out of reach: in a build
// that never compiled MG_Remote, and on Android where this module links the shipping
// libMobileGL.so built -fvisibility=hidden. A caller that gets false must SKIP.
