// The CLIENT side of P4a's texture and renderbuffer family: resource_create from the object's
// constructor, resource_respecify from every storage-defining entry point, set_texture_params
// from the parameter mutators, and resource_subdata from the DRAIN LIST at the validate point.
//
// THE THREE OBJECT CALLS ARE NOT EMITTED FROM HERE'S CALLER, they are emitted from MG_State's
// own mutators - a constructor, a storage definition, a glTexParameter - exactly as P3a's
// buffer family is, because that is where the event happens. Only the sub-data drain runs at
// the validate point, which is the explicit exception ARCHITECTURE.md 5.1 makes for texture
// upload: walking every live texture per verb is the cost the drain list exists to avoid.
//
// THIS FILE IS CREATED BY THE CONTRACT COMMIT AND FILLED BY THE PACKAGE THAT OWNS IT - see
// FramebufferEmit.h for why, in full: PipeFill.cpp is the contract package's for the whole
// phase, so the emitter package edits this header and the value of
// kMGPipeWiredTextureSubsystem below, and never that file.
//
// HEADER-ONLY, for the ownership reason Tracker.h and ResourceTracker.h both state.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// HOW MG_State REACHES THIS FILE: IT DOES NOT, AND THAT IS THE POINT (c0b, ID-13).
//
// v1 of this package shipped a deviation - six free functions here, called from
// TextureObject.cpp and RenderbufferObject.cpp - because at the contract TAG
// MG_Pipe/PipeMutation.h declared only the six DEATH helpers and this package may not edit
// A's files. c0b landed the BIRTH half, so the deviation is retired rather than carried:
// MG_State now calls MGPipeMintTextureHandle / MGPipeEmitTextureResourceCreate /
// ...ResourceRespecify / MGPipeEmitTextureParams / MGPipeNoteTextureLevelDirty and the two
// renderbuffer twins, all DECLARED in MG_Pipe/PipeMutation.h and DEFINED in
// MG_Impl/Pipe/PipeFill.cpp, which forwards to the entry points below through
// ForwardWhenWired<kMGPipeWiredTextureSubsystem>. No MG_State translation unit includes this
// header any more, which is the property check_include_closure.py's mutation-header probe
// exists to keep.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE OWES THAT SEAM, and a mismatch is a compile error in this package's own
// commit rather than a surprise at the merge (that is what the wired constant buys):
//
//   EmitResourceCreate(ITextureObject&)      EmitResourceRespecify(ITextureObject&)
//   EmitTextureParams(ITextureObject&)       NoteLevelDirty(ITextureObject&, Uint32, Uint32)
//   EmitRenderbufferCreate(RenderbufferObject&)
//   EmitRenderbufferRespecify(RenderbufferObject&)
//
// and the PUBLICATION LATCH is A's too: MGPipeNoteHandlePublished is called where a create
// actually goes out and MGPipeHandleIsPublished is what the death helpers read, so this file
// keeps no Published flag of its own.

    // emitters their bodies, with no file touched twice - and a Coverage.def row can never
    // silently drop a field on the floor before the call that carries it exists.
    //
    // IT WAS 0 IN v1, AND THE THING THAT BLOCKED IT IS NOW IN THE TREE. Unlike the other three
    // P4a families this one gets no fresh apply entry points - the catalogue is closed and a
    // texture rides P3a's OWN resource_create / resource_respecify / resource_subdata /
    // resource_destroy rows - so on a base without the wire package's per-kind record vectors
    // and its texture branch, two properties made a texture record actively harmful rather than
    // merely ignored: MGPipeApplierState::Resources was ONE slot-indexed vector, so a texture
    // create at slot 12 overwrote the BUFFER record at slot 12; and SubDataBoxFault validated
    // every record as the buffer half of MGPSubData, so a texture sub-data record was
    // Fatal{ProtocolCorruption} on `record.Level != 0` alone. Both are closed on this base
    // (three per-kind vectors, ApplyTextureUpload, SubDataTextureFault, and C1's level-scoped
    // PendingUploads clear), so the constant is its own bit and the family is live.
    //
    // THE FLIP IS THE WHOLE SWITCH AND NOTHING ELSE MOVES: PipeFill.cpp ORs this constant into
    // kMGPipeWiredSubsystems, static_asserts it is 0-or-its-own-bit, gates every birth hook on
    // FamilyIsLive(kMGPipeSubsystemTextureResources, this), and gates DrainTextureSubData on
    // the same OR. D-K2's rows - including bit 9's dependency on this family - are in
    // MG_Pipe/SubsystemDeps.def, once (P3b/P4b R-5), and are not restated here; what this

    // than that arena is Fatal{RingOverrun, "SEG_STAGE"} at the encoder rather than a split
    // (PipeWireCodec.cpp:856-864) - the same wall PipeFill.cpp's content walks are cut at. It is
    // not hypothetical: measured on the CI traces, a 512x128x33 GL_RGBA32F level is 34,603,008
    // bytes and a 192-cube GL_RGBA16 level is 56,623,104, both against the default 32 MiB
    // segment, so those glTexImage3D calls aborted their replays at the emitter.
    //
    // THE SPLIT IS INTO WHOLE-WIDTH SLABS. A piece is a set of CONSECUTIVE ROWS OF THE LEVEL
    // SHADOW - {x0, y0, z0, w, dy, dz} in level coordinates - because that is the one shape whose
    // box names both its texels and its byte run: the run begins at
    // z0 * sliceStride + y0 * rowStride + x0 * bpp and is exactly the box's own byte extent. So
    // the run's placement is derivable from the strides and box the record carries, and the far
    // side never has to know the level's format or pixel size. Whole slices are the coarsest cut
    // and the two CI blobs take it; a slice bigger than the cap falls back to whole rows, and a
    // ROW bigger than the cap to whole texels inside one row - still one box exactly matching its
    // own run, which is the property everything downstream depends on.
    //
    // THE PIECES ARE CONTIGUOUS AND ASCENDING, and their union is the level exactly once: the

    // MGPipeEmitRenderbufferRespecify and the two ...ResourceDestroy halves - because at the
    // contract tag MG_Pipe/PipeMutation.h declared no texture birth hook and
    // MG_Impl/Pipe/PipeFill.cpp's death helpers hard-coded `published = false`. Every one of
    // them is now A's:
    //
    //   * the four MINTS and the nine EMISSIONS are declared in PipeMutation.h and defined in
    //     PipeFill.cpp, which gates them on FamilyIsLive(bit, kMGPipeWiredTextureSubsystem) and
    //     forwards to this class through ForwardWhenWired. MGPipeEmitTextureParams in
    //     particular was a NAME COLLISION - the contract declares that exact signature - so
    //     keeping the inline definition here would not have compiled at all;
    //   * step 1 of the death order is inside MGPipeEmitTextureDestroyAndFree /
    //     ...RenderbufferDestroyAndFree, which read MGPipeHandleIsPublished and emit the
    //     resource_destroy themselves, so the destructors call ONE helper and not two - and
    //     since the final review's C-2 the helper then forwards to NoteTextureDied /
    //     NoteRenderbufferDied above, so no ITextureObject* survives its object in this table
    //     and no dead level survives on the drain list;
    //   * the publication latch is PipeFill.cpp's {kind, slot, gen} table, written by
    //     PublishCreate above and read by those helpers.
    //
    // The self-healing create in EmitResourceRespecify stays this file's: c0b provides no such
    // path and it is what repairs a texture born while the subsystem bit was clear.
