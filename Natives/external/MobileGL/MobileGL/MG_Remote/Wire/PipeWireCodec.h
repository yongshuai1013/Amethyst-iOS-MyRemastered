// G3: the MGPipe record codec. Owner: package w1.
//
// This header is the CONTRACT (MG_Remote/CONTRACT-P5.md) in C++ form; P5's c0 package wrote
// it so the other seven could compile on day one against signatures that cannot then move
// under them. Every body below is a named Fatal until w1 lands the real one.
//
// WHAT THIS LAYER IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
//
// It turns one MGPipe call into bytes in SEG_CMD (+ SEG_STAGE), and bytes back into ONE CALL
// OF AN EXISTING MGPipeApply* FREE FUNCTION. It owns NO semantics: MG_Pipe/PipeApply.cpp is
// not edited by this package, and a decoder arm that "handles" a record itself rather than
// delegating is a review failure (R-4's rule, one level down).
//
// THE FIVE HONESTY RULES (R-2), because they are what make `inproc` worth running at all.
// In the same address space every shortcut works: MGHostSpan::Ptr dereferences, a blobref
// whose Offset is a host address resolves, and MGPipeApplyMapPersistent's return value is a
// usable pointer. So the codec is held to the SPAWN rules even when it does not need to be:
//   1. encoder writes MGHostSpan::Ptr == nullptr and points Seg/Offset at SEG_STAGE;
//   2. encoder fills a real Seg, a real in-segment Offset and a NON-ZERO Size for every
//      MGPBlobRef that carries content;
//   3. decoder Fatal{ProtocolCorruption} on: Ptr != nullptr; a content record with
//      Blob.Size == 0; Size != 0 with Seg == kSegNone; Offset + Size past the segment;
//   4. MGPipeApplyMapPersistent returns nullptr under split (R-6; b1's half);
//   5. with MOBILEGL_IPC_AUDIT=1 the server fills a retired record's SEG_STAGE bytes with
//      0xDD, so an implementation that kept a pointer past apply reads 0xDD next frame.
//
// SEQ. The record ordinal IS the sequence number and IS the reply-slot id (R-3): there is no
// per-record seq field on the wire (ARCHITECTURE.md:124) and no second id space. Seq is
// 1-based so that 0 can mean "nothing encoded". A kRecPad wrap filler DOES NOT ADVANCE SEQ -
// both sides must skip it before counting, or every ring wrap offsets the two sides'
// numbering permanently and nothing checksums it (R-9, Ring.h's header).
