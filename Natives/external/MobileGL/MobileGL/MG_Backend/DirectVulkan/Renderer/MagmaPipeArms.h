// Magma's arm selector for the P2 Track H / render-state re-keys (P2 brief D14), and the
// {slot, gen} mint the re-keyed sites are written against.
//
// Two switches decide which arm a re-keyed site runs, and they are NOT the same switch:
//
//   MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH (compile)          - is the pushed state there to be keyed on at all
//   Features.PipePush  (runtime bitmask)  - is THIS subsystem migrated in THIS run
//   MOBILEGL_PIPE_LEGACY_MEMOS (compile)  - is the pre-handle arm compiled beside it
//   Features.PipeLegacyMemos (runtime)    - may the pre-handle arm be ENTERED in this run
//
// ARCHITECTURE.md 9.6's point: once a handle wave lands, a clear MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH bit is
// only a valid A/B while the legacy arm is still compiled, because with the bit clear the
// backend would otherwise still run the re-keyed code. So a clear bit selects the legacy
// arm, and a run that has explicitly disabled the legacy arm may not fall into it.
//
// D14 spends that last sentence at STARTUP, not per draw: "a Track-H subsystem whose bit is
// clear is a startup Fatal{PipeLegacyMemosDisabled}". Nothing in the draw path aborts, and
// nothing outside Track H consults the legacy-memo lever at all - see
// MagmaPipeValidateSubsystemConfiguration below for both halves of that rule.
//
// The whole header is inert in a pull build: MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH is 0 there, every helper
// below is behind it, and the pull build's translation units are byte-identical (G1).

    //
    // Three deliberate boundaries, each of which the per-draw shape this replaces got wrong:
    //
    //  * ONLY Magma's own Track-H bit is checked. Espryt's bit 5 is Espryt's business (a
    //    DirectVulkan run does not execute one line of DirectGLES' re-key), so
    //    MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH=0x20 must not kill a Magma run, and MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH=0x40 must
    //    not kill an Espryt one.
    //  * bit 0 (kMGPipeSubsystemRenderState) is NOT Track H and is NOT fatal. It is not a
    //    memo re-key at all: it decides where the pipeline memo's STATE KEY comes from, and
    //    a clear bit there simply means the client is not pushing render-state CSOs in this
    //    run, which GetOrCreatePipeline answers with its own state hash. D14 labels bits 5
    //    and 6 "Track H" and labels bit 0 nothing of the sort.
    //  * it is Fatal at STARTUP, once, not on a draw. A per-draw abort inside
    //    GetOrCreatePipeline turns a configuration mistake into a mid-frame crash and puts a
    //    branch nobody needs on the hottest path in the backend.
    //
    // [declared deviation from D14, review v2 minor 2] D14's runtime row reads "false: the
    // legacy arm is never entered", and D14's compile-switch row names ComputePipelineStateHash
    // as part of the pre-handle arm. Those two together would make MOBILEGL_PIPE_LEGACY_MEMOS=0

    // MagmaPipeTrackHArmIsHandles exists: three sites deciding separately could disagree,
    // and a control that defeats two of three guards proves nothing.
    //
    // WHAT IT DEFEATS, AND WHY IT IS SPELLED AS "REPLACE THE IDENTITY WITH A CONSTANT"
    // RATHER THAN "USE THE HEAP ADDRESS".
    //
    // D18 wrote the control as "hash attr.Buffer.get() instead of GetLifetimeId(), and skip
    // the vaoLifetimeId compare", on the theory that a deleted object's replacement lands at
    // the freed heap block and so reproduces the key. Measured, it does not: in
    // HandleRecycleScenario the GL NAMES come back (glGen* hands the deleted name straight
    // out) but the C++ heap blocks do not - a VertexArrayObject is 3920 bytes, too large for
    // glibc's tcache, so its chunk goes to the unsorted bin and is split by the very next
    // allocation the replacement path makes. Four create/delete cycles in one run produced
    // four distinct addresses, ~1 MiB apart. With no address reuse there is nothing for
    // "hash the address" to collide with: the replacement hashes differently, indexes a
    // different memo slot, and inherits nothing - so the arm asserted stale pixels and saw
    // fresh ones, which is a FAILING negative control that had stopped controlling anything.
    //
    // So the control no longer asks the allocator for the collision; it manufactures it. On
    // both arms the object identity is replaced by a constant, which is the strongest form of
    // "the allocator handed the block back" and is deterministic. That covers strictly more
    // than D18's spelling, and in particular it reaches the arm P2 SHIPS: on the handle arm
    // the constant defeats the OBJECT IDENTITY THAT SELECTS THE SLOT - the key the handle arm
    // ships - so the replacement VAO is handed the dead one's memo entry and its content hash.
    // Defeating only the retired lifetime-id/address guards would leave that key untested,
    // which is exactly the vacuity this control exists to catch.
    //
    // WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, AND WHY NO REPRODUCER OF THIS SHAPE CAN [fix-aba review v1,
    // MAJOR 1]. It does NOT exercise the GENERATION half of {slot, gen}:
    //
    //   * THIS MINT still has no death notification, and that is now a narrower statement than
    //     it was. P7 wave 2 package C gives DirectVulkan a StateObjectDeathOps table
    //     (DirectVulkan.cpp's g_magmaStateObjectDeathOps, CONTRACT-P7 §5.5), so
    //     NotifyStateObjectDestroyed DOES have a consumer on this backend - but that consumer's
    //     one job is to emit the `object_death` RECORD so the server drops its twin, and it
    //     never touches these per-renderer identity tables: they are the SERVER-side renderer's
    //     own, the notice is raised on the CLIENT thread, and an Acquire/retire from the wrong
    //     side is precisely the cross-role read CONTRACT-P5C §3.1 forbids. So a slot here still
    //     returns to the free list only through OnFrameBoundary's age sweep (kSweepInterval
    //     256, kRetireAgeBoundaries 1024, below), and everything the two bullets below derive
    //     from that is unchanged;
    //   * HandleRecycleScenario issues five frame boundaries, so the free list is empty when
    //     the replacement VAO acquires and it gets a BRAND-NEW slot at Gen 1 (measured:
    //     redVao slot=2 gen=1, greenVao slot=3 gen=1). The knob-off FRESH verdict there is
    //     decided by the SLOT alone, and deleting the ++Gen below leaves all four arms green;
    //   * a genuine slot REUSE needs >= 1024 idle boundaries after the dead object's last
    //     draw, which necessarily puts the two draws in different frames - and the only memo
    //     that carries a GPU slice rather than a layout, ResolvedVertexBindings, declines
    //     across frames by design. The two requirements are mutually exclusive, so the
    //     generation is out of reach of any same-frame pixel reproducer for this memo.
    //
    // The generation is covered where it IS expressible, over this mint and the claim rule
    // MagmaPipeClaimSlotMemos below: MG_Test/Pipe/MagmaPipeIdentityTest.cpp drives a real
    // retire -> reuse and asserts that a memo stamped at {slot, gen=N} is not served at
    // {slot, gen=N+1} with the knob off and IS served with it on. Deleting the ++Gen reds that
    // suite; it is the only place in the tree where that deletion is caught.
    //
    // Everything the control does NOT defeat is as load-bearing as what it does. It never
    // touches a guard that is not an IDENTITY guard: the resolved-bindings memo's frame
    // serial, its slice-epoch compares and its host-map check all stay in force, so a green
    // AbaControl arm still means "a replacement object was handed its dead predecessor's
    // resolved vertex bindings because the identity halves of the keys were defeated", not
    // "every safety net was switched off until something broke".
    //
    // Off by default (Config.h), set only by the HandleRecycle AbaControl ctest lanes, and
    // #if MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH throughout, so no shipping pull build can even parse it.
    // P4a (BRIEF-P4A.md D-I2, G8): WHICH KINDS THIS ANSWER COVERS, and it is not "all of them".
    //
    // P4a mints six more client-side kinds - Texture, Renderbuffer, Framebuffer, SamplerCso,
    // SamplerViewCso and ShaderCso - and requires the ABA control to defeat "the identity half
    // of P4a's memo keys as well", because a control that only defeats the guards a phase
    // RETIRED says nothing about the key that phase SHIPS.
    //
    // On Magma there is no such key to defeat, and that is a fact about the roadmap rather than
    // an omission here. MagmaPipeIdentityTables below mints exactly TWO kinds,
    // VertexElementsCso and Buffer; a texture, a framebuffer, a sampler, a view and a program
    // are all still reached from their frontend objects on this backend, and moving them onto
    // handles is P7's work (ROADMAP.md:24 - "Magma anything"; P4a leaves MG_Backend/DirectVulkan
    // untouched apart from this file). So the honest statement is per KIND, and it is spelled as
    // code rather than as a comment so that a caller cannot read the blanket answer above and
    // conclude the knob covers its kind:
    //
    //   * for the two kinds this backend really keys on {slot, gen}, the knob defeats the
    //     identity exactly as it always has (MagmaPipeClaimSlotMemos);
    //   * for P4a's six there is nothing here to defeat, so the answer is FALSE - and
    //     MG_IntegrationTest's HandleRecycleScenario reads that through its own build probe and
    //     makes those cases' AbaControl arm assert the CORRECT pixels while SAYING that it is
    //     not controlling anything for that kind. It does not assert a corruption that no code
    //     on this tree can produce, which would be a permanently red always-on lane.
    //
    // WHAT MAKES IT TRUE LATER, in one sentence, so the next reader does not have to derive it:
    // when a backend grows a Features.PipeHandleAbaControl consumer over its P4a object slot
    // tables - one `if` in GetOrCreate / FindByHandle, the shape MagmaPipeClaimSlotMemos already
    // has for vertex input - this function's per-kind answer becomes that consumer's, the
    // integration probe finds the consumer, and the six cases flip to expecting the corruption.

    //   1. exact identity - Gen moves whenever a slot changes owner, so a stale handle can
    //      never match a live object even if the allocator hands back the same heap address
    //      (the ABA HandleRecycleScenario reproduces);
    //   2. dense slots - the slot IS an index, so a consumer's per-slot table needs no hash,
    //      no probe and no mix;
    //   3. NO CAPACITY CLIFF. A live object's handle never changes while the object is being
    //      drawn, whatever the working set size.
    //
    // Property 3 is why this is not the fixed 2-way set-associative LRU the previous round
    // shipped. That structure evicted a LIVE object once the working set passed its capacity,
    // and every consumer memo keyed on the handle died with it: measured on a verbatim
    // transcription, 54% of uses lost their handle at 2500 live VAOs against 2048 entries, and
    // 20% at 1024 live VAOs once the lifetime ids are sparse (an app that creates and destroys
    // VAOs, which is the Minecraft chunk shape this exists for). Two of the three memos it
    // fed - the content-hash memo and the resolved-state memo - had NO capacity before this
    // package: they were unbounded mutable fields on VertexArrayObject. Introducing eviction
    // there turns one ComputeHash per VAO reconfiguration into one per DRAW, and, once the
    // buffer table thrashes too, makes the vertex-input content hash a per-draw value that
    // inserts a fresh heap-allocated BackendVertexInputState into an unbounded map on every
    // draw. That is a worse leak than the one it was introduced to avoid.
    //
    // So: grow on demand, and reclaim by AGE instead of by capacity.
    //
    //   * Acquire hits an UnorderedMap<lifetimeId, slotIndex>, in front of which sits a
    //     one-entry memo. Every re-keyed site in a draw asks about the SAME VAO, so the memo
    //     turns the five-or-six acquisitions a draw makes into one map probe plus five Uint64
    //     compares - less than the address multiply plus two-way probe the pre-handle arm ran.
    //   * OnFrameBoundary retires slots whose object has not been drawn for
    //     kRetireAgeBoundaries boundaries and returns them to a free list, so the table's
    //     footprint tracks the LIVE DRAWN working set, not objects ever created. That is the
    //     property MG_Impl/Pipe/SlotAllocator cannot have here: nothing in P2 can call its
    //     Free (the tracker emits no object-class state, BufferBackendOps::OnDestroy is handed
    //     a BackendBufferResource rather than the BufferObject, and VertexArrayObject has no
