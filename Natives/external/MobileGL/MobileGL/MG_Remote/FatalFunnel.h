// P6 `dl` (CONTRACT-P6 5.2). THE ONE PLACE A SESSION DIES.
//
// Every `Fatal{...}` under MG_Remote/ used to be an MGLOG_F followed by its own std::abort().
// a6 counted ~92 of them. Scattered, they gave the funnel's three benefits to nobody: there was
// no single place to publish a SessionFault to the peer before dying, no single telemetry point,
// and no way for a census to be sure a new death was named. This is that place.
//
// THE MESSAGE STRING IS PASSED VERBATIM, family word and all. The contract requires the log
// lines, the CI greps and every red-once to be byte-identical, so SessionFail does not compose
// the line from the family - it takes the SAME string the site used to hand MGLOG_F and forwards
// it unchanged. The family enum rides ALONGSIDE, redundantly, so the funnel knows the coarse wire
// FatalCode without parsing the string; a test asserts the enum's name appears in the string, so
// the redundancy cannot rot into disagreement.
//
// NOT in WireLog.h: that header is deliberately dependency-light (ITransport.h's rule, the
// include-graph purity gate), and this needs FatalFamily.h, which pulls the protocol header. The
// header-layer sites that must stay pure keep using WireLogFatal, whose own abort routes through
// the same publisher in WireLog.cpp.

    // WHAT IT IS. At a site whose input bytes the PEER wrote, and which already sits in a
    // function that can say "no" (Bool / MobileGLResult), a named fault no longer has to kill the
    // process: SessionLatch logs the SAME line SessionFail would (family word and all, so every
    // `Fatal{` grep, the census and the SessionFault frame read exactly as before), publishes the
    // SessionFault to the peer, records the FIRST fault (family + line), and RETURNS false. The
    // site returns failure, the decoder declines, ServerLoop::DrainRing stops applying at its
    // next check, the apply thread leaves its loop, and ServerMain::RunSession closes the session
    // cleanly and exits kSessionLatchedExitCode - a named, counted end the supervisor reaps and
    // then serves the next connection, exactly as P6.5's fork-per-session already does for a
    // crash (ID-P7-1: "下一连接照常服务" is the supervisor's, not the latch's).
    //
    // WHERE IT IS ARMED, AND WHY ONLY THERE. ArmSessionLatch() is called by exactly one site:
    // ServerMain::RunSession, i.e. the spawn / TCP session child (with or without --serve), whose
    // process IS the session. Unarmed, SessionLatch IS SessionFail - same line, same abort - and
    // that is the answer everywhere else, deliberately:
    //   * INPROC keeps Fatal. CONTRACT-P5's R-2 arms (rules A/B/C, the four honesty arms) are
    //     Fatal{ProtocolCorruption} in the formal wording, and under inproc the client and the
    //     server share one process: a latched-but-alive server would leave the client's GL thread
    //     parked on a barrier in the SAME process with no EOF to wake it, and there is no
    //     supervisor to serve a "next connection" - the process is the session. So the latch
    //     changes nothing inproc and every death test stays a death test.
    //   * THE CLIENT never arms it: a client-side arm of a shared helper (the encoder's honesty
    //     pass) is a local bug, not a peer's bytes.
    // The census (scripts/ci/fatal_census.py rule 2) checks SessionLatch calls the way it checks
    // SessionFail calls: the string must carry its `Fatal{Word` and the word must have a .def row.
