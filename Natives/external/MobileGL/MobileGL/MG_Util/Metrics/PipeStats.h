// MGPipe boundary counters (plan B section 11 "P0 - hygiene, measurement, gates and
// skeleton", and the corollary in section 2.3.1).
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. The disaggregation plan has to size two things it cannot size by
// reading the tree: how many BYTES cross the frontend/backend boundary per frame (that
// sizes SEG_STAGE and the command segment), and how many accessor CALLS and memo-gate
// probes the backends actually execute per draw (that decides whether pushing state is
// cheaper than pulling it at all). Section 2.3.1 makes the second one the load-bearing
// number: the static call-site counts everyone quoted - Espryt 124 / Magma 169 - are NOT
// the dynamic per-draw cost, because every one of those paths is memo-gated, and the real
// steady state is believed to be 10-25 accessor calls per backend per draw. Without a
// dynamic counter the P2 verdict stays a guess.
//
// COST WHEN OFF. g_pipeStatsEnabled is a plain global Bool latched once at Init() from
// MG_Config::Features.PipeStats (MOBILEGL_PIPE_STATS). Every counting site in the two
// backends is written as
//
//     if (MG_Util::PipeStats::Enabled()) MG_Util::PipeStats::Add...(...);
//
// so with the feature off a site costs one load of a hot global plus one never-taken,
// perfectly-predicted branch, and none of the counter state is touched. The counters
// themselves are relaxed atomics rather than plain integers because texture and buffer
// staging can be reached from more than one thread; relaxed adds cost nothing extra on the
// off path, which never reaches them. The off-path cost is not a guess: see the paired
// A/B in the branch's evidence.
//
// WHAT IS COUNTED AND WHAT IS NOT: see the site inventory in PipeStats.cpp. That inventory
// is the contract - it names every path that is NOT wired, because a byte class that reads
// zero while a real copy runs uncounted is worse than a missing counter.
