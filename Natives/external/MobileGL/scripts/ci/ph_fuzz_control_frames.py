"""Ph fuzz arm 1: malformed control frames against a live TCP supervisor, each refused by name.

PLAN-PH-P34B-P7.md §1.1, row "gate: fuzz arm 1 malformed control frames": the mechanism was in the
tree (Framing.h's latch, ControlInbox) and the end-to-end half was not. This is that half. It is
registered as `TcpLane.ControlFrameFuzz` (label integration-tcp) and required PASSED by CI the way
`TcpLane.SupervisorProtocolControls` is - a SKIP there is red.

Five malformations, delivered at the two places a control frame is read:

  bad_identifier           a well-formed Hello envelope finished with the file identifier 'XXXX'
  truncated_length_prefix  five bytes of the eight-byte frame header, then the peer's write side
                           closes
  oversize_length          'MGLF' and a length of 0xFFFFFFF0
  garbage_flatbuffer       a frame whose payload carries our identifier and a root offset that
                           points nowhere, so only the verifier can refuse it
  wrong_union_type         a VALID envelope of a type that is not expected there (a LogFlush as a
                           first frame; a DataBind in an established session)

(1) FIRST FRAME, read by the supervisor before it has forked anything (PH-7 (5)). Each must be
    answered with a Refuse frame naming the shape - never a bare close - with NO session child
    forked for it (/proc, and no reap line), and the supervisor must go on serving: after all of
    them, a well-formed client is welcomed and its session comes up. Before PH-7 (5) every one of
    these forked a child that `_exit(67)`ed without a word (or, for the oversize length, after
    the frame reader refused to allocate), counted as a faulted session. Three extra shapes ride
    along because they are cheap and each has its own words: a wrong magic, the 24-byte envelope
    whose tag says Hello and whose table is NULL, and a peer that says nothing at all.

(2) STEADY STATE, read by an authenticated session child after Welcome. Each must end the session
    with a named line in the server log - `WireLogError`, since a Refuse is a handshake answer and
    the session is past its handshake - and the child must exit 0 (the peer's malformation is not
    the server's fault); the next client is then welcomed. Before this package two of the five
    (the truncated frame and the wrong union type) ended the session without a word.

(3) SINGLE-SESSION SHAPE (no --serve), where the session process reads its own first frame
    through the same classification: a wrong identifier, a zero-length frame, a truncated header
    and a silent peer are each answered by name and the process exits 0, where it used to
    `_exit(67)` (or `_exit(0)`) without a word. And the one place RunSession's own token-first
    order is reachable: an unauthenticated Hello with a wrong layout or wire major is answered
    Refuse{Authentication} with nothing of ours in it.

The first-frame phase also carries the two shapes the f2-auth fix round added: a zero-length
frame, and a DataBind whose nonce is not 16 bytes (the supervisor's own named refusal).

The supervisor runs with the authentication backoff OFF (MOBILEGL_IPC_AUTH_BACKOFF_AFTER=0): every
malformation above is an authentication failure from 127.0.0.1, and with the default threshold the
closing well-formed client would be backed off - which TcpLane.SupervisorProtocolControls' own
`auth_backoff` control asserts on purpose, and which this arm is not about.

Exit 77 (SKIP) without flatc or without the server image, like the supervisor smoke.
