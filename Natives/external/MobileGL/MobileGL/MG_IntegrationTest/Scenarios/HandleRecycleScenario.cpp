// Scenario - THE HANDLE ABA (gate G8): a frontend object that dies and is replaced at the same
// heap address must not inherit the dead object's backend twin, its vertex-input state, its
// buffer contents, or its draw memo.
//
// P3a ADDS TWO WINDOWS to the four P2 wrote, because it re-keys two more object classes. The
// BUFFER (ABufferAtARecycledAddressDoesNotInheritItsPredecessorsContents) is the resource_*
// family's: a store that dies and is replaced at the same slot must not hand the replacement's
// draw the dead store's bytes. The two-buffer VERTEX SET
// (AVertexArrayAtARecycledAddressDoesNotInheritItsPredecessorsVertexBufferSet) is
// set_vertex_buffers': the per-binding buffer identities are a record of their own, separate
// from the elements blob, and a recycled VAO must not inherit its predecessor's.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Every backend memo in the tree is keyed, today, on some property of a LIVE
// frontend object: a raw `void*` owner pointer (DirectGLES' StateBackendObjectRegistry and its
// three TwinLookupMemos), a `GetLifetimeId()` (DirectVulkan's VertexInputStateFactory::ComputeHash
// and VaoDrawMemo::vaoLifetimeId), or a weak_ptr expiry test. Track H replaces all of them with an
// {slot, gen} handle. The question this scenario asks is the only one that matters about that
// change: does the NEW key actually stop the aliasing the OLD key stopped? A re-key that quietly
// dropped a guard would produce pixels from a dead object's GPU resources, and there is no other
// gate in this tree that can see it - SSIM over a 40-trace corpus cannot, because no fixture
// destroys and immediately re-creates an object with a byte-identical configuration.
//
// HOW THE ABA IS BUILT, through public GL only:
//   1. an object is created, USED IN A DRAW, and used again for a few frames, so that every
//      per-object memo in both backends is armed against it;
//   2. it is unbound (so the frontend's last SharedPtr drops - a still-bound object keeps living,
//      TextureState.cpp) and deleted;
//   3. a replacement is created IMMEDIATELY, with a byte-identical configuration, so that a
//      content hash over the configuration matches the dead object's;
//   4. the replacement is given DIFFERENT CONTENTS - a different vertex buffer, different texels,
//      a different attachment;
//   5. one draw, one readback. The pixels must come from the replacement.
//
// The public-GL proxy for "the allocator repeated itself" is the GL NAME: MobileGL's name
// allocators hand a deleted name straight back, so `TheReproducerRecyclesEveryName` asserts the
// recycle happened and every other case asserts on the name it got. When a name is NOT recycled
// the case SKIPS with that reason rather than passing - the shape
// MG_Test/State/ObjectLifetimeIdTest.cpp already uses for exactly this ("inconclusive, not
// proven").
//
// WHAT THE NAME PROXY DOES NOT BUY, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. The name comes back; the C++
// HEAP BLOCK does not. A VertexArrayObject is 3920 bytes - past glibc's tcache - so its chunk goes
// to the unsorted bin and is split by the very next allocation the replacement path makes; four
// create/delete cycles in one run of this file produced four distinct addresses about a mebibyte
// apart, and the same is true of the BufferObject. An earlier revision of this file left the
// AbaControl arm's collision to that allocator, and the consequence was the failure mode this file
// exists to prevent, in its most literal form: with nothing colliding, the replacement inherited
// nothing, the arm asserted stale pixels, saw fresh ones, and went RED in an always-on
// integration-gpu lane while every guard it was supposed to be defeating was still standing.
//
// So the AbaControl arm no longer asks the allocator for the collision - MOBILEGL_PIPE_HANDLE_ABA_CONTROL
// manufactures it, by replacing the object identity in each key with a constant (see
// MagmaPipeArms.h's MagmaPipeAbaControlDefeatsIdentity). That is the strongest form of "the
// allocator handed the block back", it is deterministic, and - the reason it matters - it defeats
// the {slot, gen} GENERATION as well as the retired lifetime id, so the control covers the key P2
// actually ships instead of only the one it replaced.
//
// AND THE ABA HAPPENS INSIDE ONE FRAME, which is not a detail. The only backend structure that can
// hand a draw a dead object's GPU slice is VulkanRenderer::ResolvedVertexBindings, and it refuses
// to be trusted across a frame boundary by design ("NO cross-frame trust"). Every other memo the
// recycle can poison holds LAYOUT, which is byte-identical between the two objects by construction
// and so cannot be seen in pixels. A reproducer that puts a frame boundary between the arming draw
// and the recycled draw therefore cannot produce wrong pixels no matter how completely the keys
// collide - it would be asserting a fact about the frame gate, not about identity.
//
// THREE ARMS, ALL ALWAYS ON (P2 brief D18). The arm is named by MGITEST_HANDLE_ARM, which is a
// HARNESS marker - the library never reads it - and the CMake wiring registers one lane per arm:
//
//   Handles     MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH default (Track H bits set), MOBILEGL_PIPE_LEGACY_MEMOS=0.
//               The {slot, gen} key is the only key in the process. Expects correct pixels.
//   Legacy      MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH=0. Today's lifetimeId + weak_ptr guards. Expects correct
//               pixels - they work, which is the point: the re-key is not fixing a live bug, it
//               is replacing a guard, and the replacement has to be at least as strong.
//   AbaControl  MOBILEGL_PIPE_HANDLE_ABA_CONTROL=1, on TWO lanes: one with MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH=0
//               (the pre-handle arm, D18's lane verbatim) and one on the handle arm
//               (MOBILEGL_PIPE_LEGACY_MEMOS=0). The knob defeats the object-identity half of
//               every vertex-input memo key on whichever arm is running - the pre-handle
//               (address, lifetime id) pair and the handle arm's {slot, gen} generation - so both
//               lanes expect the CORRUPTION. Two lanes rather than one because the guard P2 SHIPS
//               is the generation: a control that only defeated the retired guards would be green
//               forever without saying anything about the re-key, which is exactly how this arm
//               went vacuous once packages C and D landed.
//
// WHY AN ARM CAN SKIP, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A HOLE. Two of the three arms assert something that
// only EXISTS once another P2 package has landed: `Handles` needs the backend's {slot, gen} arm
// (packages C and D) and `AbaControl` needs the knob's consumer (package D). This file is written
// and merged FIRST, against the P2 contract commit, so that the AbaControl red is recorded before
// either backend is touched. Until then those arms have nothing to assert, and the honest report
// for that is a SKIP that names what is missing - never a silently-deleted registration and never
// a green that means "the thing I test does not exist yet".
//
// The skip is decided by the BUILD, not by a hand-maintained list: MG_IntegrationTest/CMakeLists.txt
// greps the backend sources for the subsystem constant and for the knob's name and passes the
// answer in as MGITEST_HANDLE_REKEY_<backend> / MGITEST_HANDLE_ABA_IMPLEMENTED, with a
// CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS on those files so the answer cannot go stale. When C and D land, the
// arms arm themselves.
//
// Those two markers are a statement about the SOURCE TREE, and they are set only in a push build,
// because that is the only build in which the thing they name is compiled: the {slot, gen} re-key
// and Features.PipeHandleAbaControl are both `#if MOBILEGL_PIPE_PUSH`. In a pull build the two
// push arms therefore skip on MGITEST_PIPE_PUSH_BUILD before they ever look at a per-arm marker -
// otherwise, once C and D landed, the pull build would run AbaControl against guards that are
// still in force (a hard red on `ctest -L integration-gpu`, which G2 requires green in BOTH
// builds) and Handles against a library with no re-key in it (a green that asserts nothing).

            // case supplies only its own churn round.
            //
            // `round(checkPixels, observe)` must create ONE object of the kind, put it through

            // validate point - an object created and destroyed without a draw has no record and no
            // slot), call `observe()` WHILE THE OBJECT IS STILL ALIVE, and then destroy it.
            //
            // `observe()` is where peakLive is sampled, and it has to be inside the round rather
            // than after it: sampled after the destroy it would only ever see the resting count,
            // and the "deaths arrive at the destructor rather than late" assertion below would be
            // vacuous - which is the one of the three that catches a death path that works but
            // runs at the wrong time (a deferred queue, a frame-boundary sweep).
            //
            // `space` says WHICH of the allocator's two spaces the three assertions are about, and
            // it is the difference between an assertion and a green that reads the wrong counter:
            // only ShaderCso has two, and only the composite case is about the band.
            //
            // `maxInFlight` is how many slots of the kind IN THAT SPACE one round may legitimately
            // hold at its peak: 1 where the round creates one object of it, more where the round
            // creates several. The composite round creates three ShaderCsos - two stage programs
            // and the composite they are flattened into - but only ONE of the three is a band
            // slot, so the band's answer is 1 and the ordinary space's would have been 3.
            // `warmUpRounds` is how many rounds run BEFORE the baseline is taken, and for one
            // kind it is not two.
            //
            // A CONTENT-ADDRESSED KIND'S SLOT IS NOT THE OBJECT'S (D-F1, ID-17's reference-count
            // ruling). SamplerCso is minted by a CACHE keyed on the parameter block: destroying
            // the frontend sampler releases its REFERENCE, and the entry then stays in the cache,
            // unreferenced, until LRU eviction at capacity 256. So a churn over N DISTINCT
            // parameter sets legitimately retains N slots however many objects carried them, and

            // leak - which is exactly what this case did on the tree where package C landed.

            // The fix is not a weaker assertion but a warmer cache: run enough warm-up rounds to

            // and the measured churn re-uses entries that already exist. The three assertions

        //
        // WHAT IS NEW HERE, stated once so the cases below can stay short. P4a mints Texture,
        // Renderbuffer, Framebuffer, SamplerCso, SamplerViewCso and ShaderCso handles on the
        // client and frees every one of them from the frontend object's own destructor, through
        // one helper per kind, in one fixed order: emit the wire delete, raise the death notice,
        // free the slot (D-I1). That shape exists because of P3a's C-1 - a client-minted CSO whose
        // only free was a backend death table Magma does not install, which leaked a slot and a
        // ~1.3 KB record per VAO until the process Fatal'd - so the leak cases below run on the
        // DirectVulkan Handles lane as well as the DirectGLES one, exactly as ID-8 requires.
        //
        // Two kinds carry a wrinkle the others do not:
        //   * FRAMEBUFFER has a handle and NO wire lifetime (D-I2). There is no framebuffer row in
        //     the call catalogue at all: the applier learns of one only through
        //     set_framebuffer_state keyed by Fbo, and the death helper does the notice and the
        //     free and emits nothing. The allocator is therefore the ONLY observable of a
        //     framebuffer's lifetime, which is what the leak case reads.
        //   * SHADERCSO covers ordinary programs AND the program-pipeline COMPOSITES minted from
        //     the reserved high band (D-H7). A composite's slot has TWO independent release paths
        //     - the pipeline cache's LRU eviction and the composite ProgramObject's destructor -
        //     which is why it gets a case of its own; the second free is a proven no-op
        //     (SlotAllocator.cpp:117-119) and this is where "proven" is measured rather than
        //     asserted in a comment.

        // 4. The renderbuffer. Espryt keeps a backend twin per frontend renderbuffer in the same
